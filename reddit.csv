From the way your post is worded, I assume, you'd expect the money to be invested in an ETF automatically.

Investing that 100‚Ç¨ christmas money could come with additional fees, but it is certainly possible.

"It's crazy how you literally defend Trump on every single point.  Can't even agree that he's proven himself to be a serial liar.

If Obama got a wiretap with a warrant, ommiting Trump's name wouldn't make or break that warrant because the content of the warrant, the cause for suspicion, is what matters.   

The intelligence community regularly surveys foreign communications, including Russian officials.  If they found something worth getting a warrant over, having Trump's name on it or not is irrelevant.

Do you admit that Trump lied about a handful of things? Do you admit that members of his cabinet lied about contact with Russia?  

And do you seriously believe that so many people around him had contact with Russia while he was completely unaware?  He's either a liar, or an inept leader who doesn't know what's going on around him."

So you are saying that a child can knowingly consent to waive their rights? 
"That is a general rule. From the very website you provided, the ATF warns that convictions can be upheld even when only one firearm was sold as long as other evidence was sufficient (e.g. sold immediately after acquiring, intent to make a profit, etc).

&gt; As noted above, there is no specific threshold number of firearms purchased or sold that triggers the licensure requirement. Similarly, there is no ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù related to the frequency of transactions that indicates whether a person is ‚Äúengaged in the business‚Äù of dealing in firearms. It is important to note, however, that even a few firearms transactions, when combined with other evidence, can be sufficient to establish that a person is ‚Äúengaged in the business‚Äù of dealing in firearms. For example, courts have upheld convictions for dealing without a license when as few as two firearms were sold, or when only one or two transactions took place."

"I would say that the issues of Ivanka Trump's shoes in the scheme of things is not very politically relevant. Ivanka herself is not a politician, the President himself doesn't seem to use her product line as an income stream for himself, so other than him pimping her shoes on Twitter, I think it's a non issue, a diversion from what we ought to be paying attention to.  But, It's an issue that is simple to understand and allows some one to easily be on one side or the other, (like sports!) and possibly allows your friend to categorize you as a certain type of voter and be mad at someone, which is unfair to you. My advice is to stand your ground. It's no fun to get yelled at, but if you know you feel a certain way, stay calm and stick to your opinion, don't say anything mean, Then change the subject.

"If the intermediate scrutiny that the courts purport to apply was actually applied (rather than deferring to legislatures base assertions that public safety is furthered by restrictive schemes, effectively turning into rational basis) I'd be more ok with it personally. You don't get much that strict scrutiny applies to. But intermediate scrutiny, *real* intermediate scrutiny, doesn't treat ""public safety"" as a magic want where all critical thinking stops. Places like Idaho and Vermont serve as strong counterexamples to the basic ""mo' guns, mo' homicide"" narrative, and when most homicides are via handgun (ownership of which is explicitly protected via *Heller* and *McDonald*), the link to ""assault weapons"" is tenuous at best. The fit between the law and the public interest doesn't have to be perfect, but it does have to be ""substantially related."""

This sentiment gets to the whole thing.  Some people like some spending, other people like other spending.  I really hate it when people talk about the Republicans as the ""balance the budget"" party and the Democrats as the ""spend spend spend"" party.  Both parties have the stuff they like to spend money on, and they do so.

I think your comment is very well put...Trump does plan to spend big.  And I agree, the infrastructure spending is something we sorely need and I really hope he pulls through.

As for ""what do you get out of that spending""...that's a very complicated question that lots of people will argue for days about.  Many people would dispute your claim that we get nothing out of foreign aid (including, for example, Trump's appointment as Secretary of State) and would actually suggest that the 54 billion that is going to the military will buy a lot less than the 30% cut to the State Department's budget that he's proposing.

"Right, but coming from a standpoint of recognizing how absurd it all is, we can evaluate whether we should tolerate (socially, not legally) the worldview or not by discussing how it ought to make us feel, or what lessons it imprints on those who hold it. Obviously, if an all powerful god wants us to stick forks in our eyes, and he is real and true, and will eternally punish us for disobeying, we should stick forks in our eyes; I don't argue that truth is what matters. However, here in r/atheism, I'm starting from the obvious fact that your God is made up by man and is a silly superstition.

We tolerate cults and strange subcultures provided their views don't significantly harm society. If they are suicide or doomsday or noncensensual sex cults, then we dont' tolerate them.

"Excess cash isn't needed in the short term. Short term = operating account(s). Those are the funds you use for purchases (Payables) and they are replenished when you get paid (Receivables).

A lot of businesses in good financial standing also likely have an operating line of credit to meet immediate needs if the operating account isn't sufficient. Many operating accounts will automatically ""overdraw"" to your operating line (think overdraft on a personal bank account).

True ""excess cash"" to a business is cash you know you can safely divert to an investment, even if it's only for a 1 year term. Depending on the liquid assets and investing approach of the company they may have anything from GICs to money market index/mutuals, to bonds, stocks, or direct investments in other businesses/projects/joint ventures etc. You can even buy assets and lease them out to other businesses, and the the money you make after paying for the asset is your return."

There is no reason to think that the brain is somehow so special that this impaired function does not also happen to the brain.  Let us not gloss over mental illness completely just because it is true and just and right that we should be more tolerant about mental illness.

There are studies that show that people who are (supposedly) mentally ill have more blood relatives who are highly creative, and people who are highly creative have more blood relatives who are (supposedly) mentally ill.  The theory is that society needs creative people, but if someone got too many genes for creativity they might become (supposedly) mentally ill.  Obviously in such case more tolerance would help them and might even help society.  This is exactly like sickle cell anemia.  People with one sickle cell gene are more immune to malaria, but people with two sickle cell genes get sickle cell disease and are pretty freaking miserable and don't live very long."
"Awww that's sucks, sorry it didn't work out for you. The pigment is pretty intense so I know what you mean.

"&gt;They pay more in tax cause they have the money to afford the taxes. You can't get blood from a stone.

Agreed. I don't think the amount they are taxed is wrong. You led off the conversation saying if we taxed the rich, obviously meaning increased taxes on the rich, we wouldn't have a problem. I was just pointing out that the rich already bear the brunt of taxes, and while I'm a conservative, against more taxation in general, they probably should.

&gt;I'm not sure about medicare, but SS is solvent through like 2027 based on current projections. If they'd lifted the cap in 1983 when the Greenspan commission first looked into solvency concerns we wouldn't even be having this discussion.

You're right about this one, I should have said Social Security is headed towards insolvency (though you probably disagree with that)

&gt;The point is entitlements shouldn't be lumped in with regular budget spending because it can and does pay for itself with its own tax. If you look at discretionary spending over half is on the military.

I don't agree that is shouldn't get lumped in with normal spending simply because it's payed for with FICA taxes. The fact is, entitlements are the main drivers of deficits, and the costs continue to increase.

And while you may not be interested in foreign policy, my main frustration when discussing military spending cuts is people seem to believe that the budget can simply be slashed, with Lockheed Martins stock the only sacrifice. Serious commitments beneficial to the country and the world would be waived if military spending was cut further, with real ramifications for national security and US interests."

The maoist conitel op was certainly successful. It was also inter-territorial. Would India have the operational capacity and logistical support to wage that kind of operation on the otherside of the globe? I'm not so sure. In fact I very much doubt it.

I would never defend US intervention in the ME. Its been a disaster. But to chalk that up to military failure is silly. It has predominetly been a nation building failure.

If the US wants your regime gone, its gone. If they want to end your status quo governmental organization? Its ended.

But that doesnt mean the US is successul at engaging ideologically and building successful friendly governments in its place. But no previous empire you alluded to in your previous post was either in the 21st century sense. 

The US, attempts, to retain a semblance of sovereignty and civilian safety.

If the US acted as the Romans, who literally salted the fields of an entire fucking nation, or the mongols, who laid waste to entire civilian populations, or the British, who subjected nations and created oppresive colonial regimes, then the US may have ""fared"" differently in their operations in the ME and SE asia.

The US is no saint and has seen some serious military failures, most strikingly imo Tora Bora wherein Osama could have been encircled and captured if not for the Bush admin's incompetence, but I find your comparisons to different historical empires nonsenseical bordering on ignorant.

"You can ~~easily~~ come to that conclusion without religion.

Just because some people can **easily** doesn't mean other can **easily**.

I could say that since abortions will happen no matter what one should **easily** come to the logical conclusion that they should be made as safe as possible. But we both know there's a whole lot of people that won't come to that conclusion.

&gt; Motives don't matter nearly as much as the case you can make for it on the Congressional floor.

This is true, but the case that is consistently brought up by the anti-abortion folks is God and Bible and Sin. 

&gt; And, as I mentioned in another comment, there's a wide gulf between ""something is legal"" and ""something is propped up with large amounts of federal dollars"".

And where is the information on how much **federal dollars** are spent on abortions? I was under the impression (based on the laws on the books) that federal dollars can't be used to perform abortions.

One last point. What percentage of anti-abortion proponents came to that conclusion without religion? I'm just asking for a guess here because based on every single bit of personally anecdotal evidence, I only know 1 anti-abortion non-religious person. I would guess that upwards of 99% of anti-abortion people believe that through religion. "

"I'm going to guess it'll actually be more interesting than anyone anticipates. The thing about that region of space is that the event horizon isn't really the interesting aspect of it, that's the boring part where stuff goes to die. The interesting aspect is that it is a region of intense gravitation shoved into a very small volume. Matter *wants* to fall into the black hole, but it has a hard time getting there due to the size of the event horizon, and along the way that matter becomes extremely compressed, super accelerated, ionized, and heated to extraordinary temperatures. That then leads to a host of other secondary phenomena such as strong magnetic fields, creation of large quantities of anti-matter, axial jets, etc. It should be fascinating."

"You seriously *do* think that? You probably also think Clinton had people murdered in the '90s, too. üôÑ This type of willful ignorance is why we have an orange shitgibbon and his Darth Vader wannabe overlord in office right now.

The problem with that is other agencies whom she sent and received emails to and from *also* had copies of those emails, so her putting them on a private server made transparency issues more complicated but certainly didn't *hide* anything. The emails she didn't turn over were decided by her legal team to be private, non-work related and thus not turned over.  However, later it was determined, because of the search terms the legal team used, that work related emails could have been in those emails not turned over and deleted.  Clinton and her team readily admitted to the possibility, were apologetic and helpful in the FBIs attempts to recover the deleted emails.  Hardly the acts of people trying desperately to cover up illegal actions.  And the FBI did find thousands upon thousands of those emails, and determined while some did turn out to be work related those emails weren't classified and didn't pose a security breach, *and* there was no intention to delete them in order to hide criminal activity.  Sure, some of those weren't found, but considering all but a very few (3 were found to be classified at the time but not properly marked as such, which meant it was plausible Clinton didn't know nor those who sent and received the email) of any of the emails, those turned over as well as those deleted, were found to be classified or work related (regarding the deleted emails), the chances that something criminal was purposefully covered up, hidden or deleted purposefully is slim.

Feel free to read anything other than right-wing blog sites, conspiracy sites and Fox News to get a broader perspective on the subject.  Just as the FBI concluded after extensive and exhaustive investigation (which included finding those supposedly hidden emails with other agencies and through forensic examination), what Clinton did was *grossly negligent*, but not illegal, purposeful in the sense of intentionally hiding anything, or criminal.

I like her pieces that stay domestic, but as soon as she starts talking foreign policy, it becomes clear she's firing from the hip. Well-intentioned, but simply uninformed and unaware of it.

First of all, she doesn't consider the possibility that (stay with me here), the Dems are crooked enough to use Russia as a red herring **and** Flynn was a piece of shit, which he was. He was pretty much universally hated by his subordinates because he indulged in Dubya Logic, that is to say, ""I have a conclusion, go find me proof!"" And if you didn't find the proof he liked, he whined and screamed like a child. In fact, it was much like Trump's request to the DHS to find justification for his Muslim ban. I suspect Flynn might have taught him to do that.

Russia's up to some shady shit, and I really don't think that's very debatable. The question, then, is how to respond? The establishment Democrats are way over the top with military force. Very not necessary, **seriously** not necessary. All we really need to do is keep the sanctions in place, you know, the ones we agreed on after consulting with NATO and the EU? They're really effective, and will starve the Russian military machine if we let them. There's no reason to go send troops like Bloody Hillary wanted.

I don't know what the media babbled about, but in the IC, we were more thinking about indicting Flynn because he *lied under oath*. Same thing Clinton was impeached for. We were also pretty livid that someone who is so cozy and beholden to a foreign power was allowed access to classified material. We weren't upset by who he was talking with, but rather **what** he was talking with them about. What happened just after January 20 was rather shady, by any standards. It made good sense to get rid of Flynn, no matter what he believed. We cannot have a leader that puts anything else before the citizens and country he has sworn to serve. [*Disclaimer: This entire paragraph is all from open source and a bit of inductive reasoning. I do not actually have any access (secondhand or otherwise) to the relevant information.*]

McMaster really isn't out from left field to anybody in the Department of Defense. He's rather close with Mattis, another even hand that we tend to desperately hope and pray keeps Trump from going too stupid. Because as mad as 'Mad Dog' might be, he's not going to throw his boys and girls into harms way over the ravings of a lunatic. McMaster will likely be more of the same, less of Flynn's fanboyism and more calm academia. Sure, he's got a silly Southern twang, but I can forgive him that. It's actually mildly endearing. 

I guess I'm just annoyed that there's so many strong emotions running and hysteria that keeps people from thinking straight. This isn't a binary choice here, it doesn't **have** to be one or the other in the right, nor is it a zero sum game. Here, both are both wrong, and both are *really* wrong.

tl;dr Flynn actually *was* a fucktard, but not for the hysteria you see on TV. McMaster is probably a good calming presence in the NSC. Establishment Democrats are also stupid for wanting military escalation. Surprise, both parties are dirty. I thought that's why we wanted change in the first place, but hey, that's just me."

"&gt; like I said before there are certain misconceptions that abound and are accepted without question. This is a serious flaw.

That is your job as a user, not ours as moderators.  If you want to challenge conventional wisdom or bad analysis then please do so (with sources and in a civil manner) because we need a lot more of that.  So if it is a flaw, it is your own.  I already spend most of my time moderating, I have very little time to dedicate towards refuting bad commentary or articles.  Sometimes such comments merit removal, but more often they require actual refutation (which is a lot of work).  I would agree that we have not gone far enough yet in terms of improving quality, but this will require a lot of time and effort, both on the part of the moderator team, but also the users (who actually have far greater power as a whole to change the sub than mods imo).  Remember that Rome wasn't built in a day.

We are looking to large quality subs like /r/AskHistorians for guidance, but there's only so much we can do right now.  Once we've ironed out the submission statement rule and added new mods, I would like to improve policy of comment quality and I think those subs have some good ideas."
"No, the opposite actually.

Due to dark energy, the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion.

Simply put - that means that huge objects (eg., galaxies) at vast distances from each other, are moving away from each other.

Since it is a metric expansion - it is easy to calculate that the most distant galaxies are moving away from us faster then *c* (speed of light).

Now... are these really moving faster than *c*?  No.  The far away galaxy is moving at the same speed and direction it always was.

But... in the very very empty parts of space between us and it, the dark energy is making more space.  At a certain distance, there is so much new space being created (between us and it) that light can no longer reach us from that point (eg., space is expanding faster than *c*).

Dark energy is very very weak, compared to gravity (which itself is very weak, which you can prove by jumping).  So things that are close are still gravitationally bound.

So our local galactic cluster is still gravitationally bound, and thus not being influenced as much by dark energy.  Same for our galaxy, our solar system, stars, planets, you, me.

Eventually, if this continues, dark energy will remove all the distant galaxies from our view... the universe will slowly go dark and cold.  It will eventually even effect locally bound objects (in trillions of years)."

It's literally more expensive for them to accept Bitcoin than it is to just take debit card payments.

"Although Nike reported a surprisingly large EPS beat, its $8.43 billion in quarterly sales, a 5 percent increase, came up just short of the $8.47 billion expected. I believe the main reason for the EPS beat is due to the demand creation expenses that dropped 7%, and that taxes dropped 250 basis points to 13.8%, resulting in a deceptively large earnings beat due to lower spending. Also decreasing margins, increasing popularity and pressure from other competitors like Adidas and under armour, and no significant innovation from Nike likely contributed to the drop. All in all theres still a lot to consider and its only down by 1.15% AH, who knows what will happen tomorrow. "

"News isn't very profitable on it's face (in terms of making money from viewership, newspaper sales, etc.) So there's not really a huge economic incentive to do it just to make money.

The value comes from the massive amount of influence it gives you. 

Rupert Murdoch of News Corp/Fox News is an actual right-wing Ideologue and Media is the only business he does. 

Carlos Slim and Jeff Bezos, who bought the New York Times and Washington Post are the richest and third richest, people in the world, and likely did so because it gives them influence, feeding their ego. Or a cynic would say, as propaganda for their corporate empires.   

As to exactly why all major Media is liberal, my best guess is simply because the journalists themselves are progressive and have gotten increasingly so over the years (as Academia has morphed from a place of valuing challenging ideas into shutting down all non-progressive ideas). Or it's just become a self-fulfilling thing, the default, making it the easy choice that won't stir up any trouble for yourself, and Corporations may just not want to rock the boat in a blatant manner."

He said this was done to force buyers to take their cars to the dealers for everything to make more profit.

The replacement for Medicaid tax credits were health savings accounts, and reimbursement of X amount of money.

Same for the HSAs, if you haven't put money into it, you're shit out of luck. They're ignoring the fact that most people in this country (and around the world for that matter) can't just front the money and wait for the government to pay them back.

"That's more a question of ""what is our current infrastructure capable of"" and unfortunately radio astronomy isn't my thing. I'd expect it's quite weak however. In general however the answer to ""whats the lower limit"" can be rephrased as ""how big of an antenna do you want to build? 

Mars, depressingly enough, has better ""internet"" (air quotes) than some parts of the USA. It depends on the mission of course. The Mars reconnaissance orbiter can transmit data up to 6 megabits per second.  The Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity is the rover half of that), is more limited, but that's mostly a result of it's limited communication with it's satellite around mars. They only get to :""talk"" for about 8 minutes a day, and so the orbiter has all day to relay the data back to earth, and there's no need to put in a beefy transmitter. It still gets about 32 kbits per second though. That means it takes 20ish hours for the rovers daily data dump to finish transmitting. "

If you dont have the money and can get a loan, you could do that. But if you have a collection on your credit, Its highly possible you wont be accepted or you will get a high interest rate. You'll need the settlement letter also for that. Hope this helps"

"This replay issue is so overblown it's not even funny. If you don't want your transaction broadcast on both chains, just send them to two different addresses on each fork, respectively in the same block.

If a lowly user like me can figure this out, surely the exchanges can handle the same issue in a similar manner."

"Except she didn't win them, Trump did. So much for that courting moderates strategy.

The simple fact that people have to wilfully ignore to miss is that Clinton didn't win the primary because her position was more attractive to more people. She won because the DNC, the establishment, and the media tilted everything hard in her favor. In spite of all that she didn't win by much.

She didn't lose the general because of Russia, Comey, or any other percieved reason. She lost because, in spite of every advantage given, she was an aweful candidate with way too much baggage that represented everything currently wrong with Washington.

Trump lucked out in that first the media pushed him non stop in order to give Clinton an easy opponent (and keep attention off of Hillary and Bernie on the Democratic side), then faced off against the one Democrat that even he, in spite of being totally incompetent and unqualified for the job, could beat.

So now we're all stuck with Trump. And no one with influence or authority, not the Democratic party, nor the establishment politicians, nor the media is willing to take one bit of responsibility for any of it."

I'm sure we are all frustrated with the process (I know I am), but it does seem to be more or less working as intended. The network for example still churns through transactions hour after hour, day after day, securing coins from friend and foe without a problem. 

When you step back and look at all the drama and the bullshit going on, and then realize that the network is working just fine despite these very vested and adversarial actors involved in the system, its actually quite amazing."

"Real Estate agents get a lot of business by word of mouth, and that means having contacts, and reminding past customers that they're still around.  Even if you're not thinking of selling your house or buying another one, they count on the fact that maybe a relative or friend of yours might be interested soon, and you'll remember that agent that wished you  a happy birthday, and make a referral.

I still get christmas cards in the mail from the agent I used to buy my house.  By contrast, typing in a few words on a Facebook wall takes very little effort and time."

A quick look [suggests](https://www.cdc.gov/media/dpk/alcohol/alcohol-poisoning/dpk-vs-alcohol-poisoning.html) 2,200 deaths in the US each year due to alcohol poisoning. Which is roughly the same heroin overdoses in Ohio alone. And even then, we are talking about consuming large quantities and it's spread out across the country.

It appears that Ohio is comfortably leading the country in these kinds of overdoses, in absolute terms. To me, that makes it worthy of a discussion on it's own merit.

How does this square with Farage being known for being extremely right wing even as a schoolboy? He likes ale, and is therefore suspicious. I didn't realise being a former banker precluded you from enjoying ale. He worked in the EU parliament, and exposed scandals (can't say I've ever seen him do that) so must be informed by the neo-liberal elite? Perhaps because he worked there he knew more about the EU than us plebs because it was his job. If Farage is controlled by ""neo-liberal puppet masters"", why isn't Corbyn? I could argue Corbyn is a useful idiot to discredit the left for another generation by ""globalists"" - by showing the left as completely incompetent it makes them electoral kryptonite. At least that makes sense even though there's no evidence for what i just wrote.

I wasn't clear in my response though, when I said Bitcoin needed to be big, I was thinking of PoW, and how it is quantitative, rather than qualitative, security. Bitcoins security model rests on the assumption that it has ""lots"" of hashing behind it. If the hash rate fell to 1% of what is was today, or 99x as much SHA256 hash power were directed at another coin, Bitcoin would be very easy to attack.

You made a fair point though, about political safety resulting (or not!) from size. It's good to keep that in mind, although I tend to be of the opinion that the more widely used it is, the more politically unpalatable it will be to to try to outlaw it."

"Hi Jihan Wu. Segwit and second layers will only improve bitcoin giving it more value. A higher price should benefit miners as well.

Even after that, practically no one thinks we should keep the small blocksize ""forever"". Just activate Segwit already, let the different innovative teams work on cool decentralized second layer solutions that will probably improve bitcoin and start the discussions for a realistic safe properly-planned dynamic blocksize increase (""emergent consensus"" is obviously not a real option.)

"The genes actually do ""remember"" where they came from. It's a large part of a field called epigenetics.  Basically your cells have certain ways to ""turn off"" genes this can involve sticking a methyl group (-CH3) onto the DNA, or by putting charges onto the things that the DNA coils around (histone deacetylation) which regulates how much a gene shows.  Your body when making an egg or sperm will do these things to regulate which genes your children will express. This can actually result in some pretty interesting consequences for genetic disease.

In Prader-willi syndrome, you don't have a paternal chromosome 15, or you have a deletion of part of chromosome 15 from your father.  Certain genes on the maternal chromosome are inactivated and so you develop the syndrome despite having completely functioning genes.  One way this occurs is you have your mother accidentally give two chromosome 15's and then your body undergoes something called trisomy rescue in which one of the chomosomes are kicked out.  If the paternal chromosome is kicked out, then you develop prader-willi despite having a completely normal set of chromosomes without any significant mutations.  The same thing can happen where you don't have a maternal chromome 15 in which case you develop angelman syndrome."

"&gt; My entire comment was about macroevolution - small changes that lead to entirely new body plans. 

Sure that's what you mean.  You're a creationist, so you really aren't fooling anybody.  All life is the result of evolution, whatever bogus term you use to try to cast doubt on that doesn't really matter to me.

&gt; I believe in the other types of evolution, small changes within body plans. 

The notion of body plans is one of those aforementioned bogus terms.  Evolution doesn't do body plans.  It does gradual changes over time, which has resulted in all the body types of all the terrestrial forms you see today.

&gt; But I also don't believe in chemical evolution where simple chemicals can evolve in to complex entities.

That's because this is another fabrication that no biologist ever has embraced.  Abiogenesis isn't evolution, nor do proponents of abiogenesis claim that complex entities arose from it. 

&gt; That said, do you believe that all life forms evolved from a single cell over time, and through chance?

From a set of early bacteria that themselves were probably from a set of early bionts.  But not by chance, because that's another red herring creationists use.  Selection is about fitness, not randomness.  Selection is just that, a non-random process where things best able survive tend to outsurvive things less able to survive (see, it's so simple it's almost a tautology).  Mutation is random, which mutations survive is not.

secondly belief is not a choice, even if i would want to believe because of these advantages it is not something you can do at will. try for yourself to believe your walls are red-green blocked, you might imagine, you might pretend, but you can't believe. beliefs are conclusions, not choices.

"&gt;Again, though, these are comments about Christianity, not Jesus. Christianity was absolutely a thing, but this doesn't do much for the historicity of Jesus himself.

I'm not sure how you arrived at that. If you are going to claim that Jesus was a later invention then you need to account for the early creeds used by the church within a few years after his death (e.g., 1 Cor 15:3-8). It would take a significant amount of time for such a remarkable legend as a made-up Jesus to make its way into the church, at least until all potential eye-witnesses were dead and gone. Yet we find that not only did the early church affirm his existence (of course they did!), but also that he died for their sins and was raised the third day. How do you explain this early creed?

&gt;And the purpose of bringing up Paul's vision is that I don't think he's qualified to make off-the-cuff comments.

Every historian disagrees with you! Paul was certainly biased about Jesus, but so is every writer at that time, and regardless, it's irrelevant. His statement about James, the ""brother of the Lord"" would be something his audience would know (otherwise he wouldn't mention it). 

Paul never claimed he saw a ghost. He claimed to have seen the risen Jesus. You can't use your philosophical naturalism as an argument against supernaturalism a priori. That's called begging the question.

"I'm 35. I'm from Auckland New Zealand. My first taste of entrepreneurship was age 11 selling sweets to classmates at 1000% markup. It was good but scaling was difficult due to bootstrapping. In hindsight I should have taken on VC from my parents and probably focused on building a killer sales team on commission, then creating new verticals to cater to various markets.

I started my first proper business at 26 because I hated having a job and a cubicle. I experienced Sunday dread along with Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday dread. Thursday and Friday were ok. 

I just wanted to not have to go to a job every day, and was not remotely focused on how to build a successful business beyond paying myself a modest salary. I wanted to work on songs and play guitar all day.

I started a live band agency at 26 which is now my main income stream. That's 9 years in and taught me business via the school of hard knocks. I also recorded and released 2 albums and a handful of music videos, mainly funded through my entrepreneurship.

I'm now 4 years in with an online wedding advertising platform, and we're about to pivot with that into corporate event venues.

From here I hope to teach others how to build an online business, and launch and podcast and speaking career around that."

"[Jobs](http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/10/news/economy/february-jobs-report/). This started right after he was elected, company after company worried about his tax plans, choosing not to move jobs away &amp; announcing it in the press. Maybe you missed it?

[National debt](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/835479283699224576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) - is it true? We'll have to wait &amp; see. He'll be proven right or he'll be proven wrong. I'm very pleased that this is on his radar, versus Obama who doubled the debt during his presidency.

I can tell you some things about Yemen. By the time the media says the civil war had started, the country had already been divided into two for a year. I saw this myself on local news because I lived just across the border at the time. An Arab friend of mine sat and translated for me. It was a full year before anyone in the west commented on it, and they all acted like it was a brand new story. No one wanted to admit they had ignored the story for a year because who cares about Yemen.

We are still bombing in Yemen, which I didn't realize. I thought it was just the raid, and had to go looking. It's not well reported and most of the sources I found were questionable. I will keep an eye out for this because [26,171 bombs a year](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/09/america-dropped-26171-bombs-2016-obama-legacy) where [90% of the victims are civilians](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/) is completely unacceptable, from any president. I think it's abominable what the US has been doing over the past 16 years, worldwide, and I want to see it stop.

I'm convinced based on this that the US committed war crimes - or at least knowingly helped Saudi to do so. I'm not sure it doesn't constitute war crimes to be killing that many civilians every year. I do believe history will not remember Obama kindly when the politics of the moment fade.

Here's the thing: I support a lot of what Trump is doing. But I'm not blind and I don't expect him to get everything right. Blindly hating him is just as stupid as blindly following him. Either way you'll still be wrong half the time.

I hope Mattis has a plan to get this all under control and end it. Obama's legacy in this area is a terrible one. I can't imagine that Trump's ego will allow him to simply continue Obama's useless campaign of terror throughout the world."

"More and more manufacturer move to bpa free cans but it's still a long way to go and when they move to bpa free cans, it may not be all at once so some products may still come in cans with bpa. I buy cans from Eden a lot, all of their cans are BPA free (edit: and it's written on the can). [This link](http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/7-companies-you-can-trust-to-use-bpa-free-cans.html) (dated last year) talks more about specific companies and their cans.

Btw here is an [article](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/mar/31/bpa-chemical-canned-food-general-mills-campbells-soup-del-monte-fda) about cans and bpa.

I started mealprepping tomato sauce and freezing it in glass jars which has been working great so far. I'm planning to do the same with cooked beans. Dry beans are so cheap but I typiclaly need small quantities and I've been defaulting to cans so hopefully it will help there. Btw little warning that I was given, if you freeze in glass jars be extremely careful with temperature shifts, no microwaving it or putting in hot water to speed the thawing or the jar can break (and you don't want it to explode, specifically in your hands). And before freezing, leave space on top for the product to expand when frozen, wait for the content to be cold, and then put the jars in the freezer without screwing the lid. The following day or so when it's frozen, you can screw the lids.

Edit: not a fan of cream of mushrooms (less temptation here!!), but I believe the bulk shop near me has a cream of mushroom power in bulk. So maybe keep an eye for that? Or maybe you can buy packaged cream of mushroom powders, which may still cut down on waste versus canned creams?"

"A few things: IIRC you are not US based correct? If you are outside USA you should be OK, IB no longer offers spot to US clients (unless you have $10MM in funds fucking lolz)

The BRE index roughly correlates with the USDBRL spot pair. This is one option for you, beware of low/zero liquidity and slippage.... You may not be able to exit! This seems like the most likely play for you If you choose to go forward because:

[If you look at IBs spot offerings](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=759) it doesn't seem to include the BRL.  They don't offer a spot position for you.  So, you have choices:

* If you want to stay inside IB you will be playing the index.  Spot is not an option

Or

* Open a spot account with a retail fx trader who offers it, then hedge accordingly.  Be aware that spot FX is a bastard and much harder than futures, my man. Slippage, huge spreads and illiquidity are a reality in FX exotics (BRL is an exotic - not one of the ""big 8"" majors). 

* Also, if you do this, be aware of the Real's unique flavor:

Short version: the Real is a dog currency, minimal volume, not carried by many brokers. you may actually save money just by nor taking a position on the Real, the risk you face with spot is a spread so wide that you either hit a stop loss or that any gains are nommed by that spread. Additional edit: there is a black market price for the Real that undercuts legit fx trading. Nowhere near as bad as Venezuelan prices for their money... But still tangible. 

One option is to take a counter position to the coffee future by playing EWZ, but this is the MSCI Brazil ETF, not a currency.

Lastly - Brazil is #1 for coffee production with ~2.8 million US tons, but the 2nd, 3rd and 4th place producers (Vietnam, Columbia, and Indonesia respectively) beat that together at ~ 3.5 million US tons combined, so there's that to consider as well. 

Do not overlook Brazil's turbulent politico-economic situation, also.

Basically, a new dingo genome adds very little new to science (while having a bunch of genomes of a species allows a lot of insight, there's not much you can do with two genomes of a species that can't be done with one). Meanwhile, we have no genome for the bombardier or 40,000 of its closest relatives--meaning that a pretty large branch on the tree of life, one that's been evolving for tens or hundreds of million years--is still dark to us even today in the genomic age.

The frustrating part for a lot of people with an engineering background is that changing a 1MB to an X-MB is as simple a change as when the 1MB was put there in the first place when they just changed a 32MB to a 1MB. 

There is no technical or economic reason to limit the transaction rate of the blockchain below what technology can allow. Unfortunately controversy is intentionally being manufactured by many people who have an economic incentive to limit the capacity of Bitcoin, so they can sell their transaction network (which is not bitcoin). 

It's great for Bitcoin that people develop second-layer solutions, but they shouldn't try to artificially cripple the blockchain below the limits of technology in order to force traffic off of it.

In any case splitting the blockchain isn't going to be bad, and in fact splits are necessary for the long-term survival since survival can't happen without a split. When the split happens, the market will have to decide whether it wants to place more value on the blockchain that everybody can use, or the blockchain that only supports at most 3 uses per second. "

3. Lots of people, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you really want to use an RRSP for retirement, and you know you'll be able to make those contributions. It's one more bill that you have to think about, and if you don't pay it back it's added to your income when you're possibly making more."

"If this is true, then those in the video should approach it in the same way that LGBT folks have approached the issue if it was any other religion refusing service; however, your source is not out for advancing our rights, but is instead pushing islamophobia and trying to get a ""gotcha"" moment by showing the LGBT community's perceived favor of Muslims over Christians. 

More so, the general consensus specifically related to baking, is that someone can refuse to put anything on a cake. You're not going to make a gay person decorate an anti-gay themed cake for a Baptist event. Instead, you cannot refuse someone service for the very act of being a protected class. Unfortunately, Michigan does not have state wide LGBT protections and only has a handful of municipal protections (Dearborn is not one of those municipalities). So, in essence, even if this Muslim turned down someone for the sheer fact of being gay, it is legal. Go across the street to Dearborn Heights, and both gender identity and sexuality is protected and it would be an illegal action. 

It's a complicated situation, and I guarantee that anywhere there has been a fight between a Christian baker and a gay customer there has been some form of sexuality protections in place and the store owner was discriminating against the LGBT party specifically for being gay. It's the only way it would stand up in court.

Why was so much of this not disclosed?  Why, if Sessions was just doing senatorial stuff, did no one else in his committee, or in other presidential campaigns meet with Kisiyak in 2016?  Why did Kushner sneak Kisiyak in to Trump Tower, and why was this not disclosed to Pence if it was done knowingly by two members of Trump's inner circle.  If nothing happened, why so much hiding in plain sight?  
Conjecture here. No proof, zero, zilch, nada:  Doing so is making problems worse, the ""cover up"" is going to get Sessions.  Sessions and Kushner are on the innermost circle here.  Even without proof, things are becoming politically toxic.  This unified republican congress with Trump's administration, are quickly running out of bandwidth to do anything except tailspin around continued Russian allegations.  We have proof of that.  We'll both get to watch it play itself out in the next news cyclce.

"&gt;Do you have actual evidence of this, or is this just your gut feeling?

It is extraordinarily difficult to overstate the contribution that research into nuclear energy has had in the broader fields of engineering and computer science.  

I'm personally coming from a mechanical engineering background, and much of the initial work in the numerical modeling and scientific computing that I use today came out of those early nuclear researchers.  All engineering design today is driven by computer analysis that had its foundation laid at that time...everything the general public takes for granted: the structural and thermodynamic systems that comprise the vehicles they drive, ride, and fly in, the RF and computer systems that spread information and communication through complex multilayer networks, even the vast engine of mechanization that provides the goods they consume.  All of this has been built, optimized, and analyzed with numerical modeling that was really first put to practice with (and thus was the scientific community's initial knowledge developed by) the adoption of FORTRAN by nuclear energy researchers backed with the funding of the US Atomic Energy Commission.  

And beyond the contributions to numerical computing, nuclear research has given us enormous advances in our understanding and practice of theoretical physics, advanced materials, corrosion, and medicine.  Building a comprehensive list of these contributions could easily consume a historian's life work, especially since much of it is wrapped up in publications dating back to the 50s and 60s.

&gt; I will readily admit to not having enough knowledge of the science and economics in either field to give a knowledgeable opinion. But my impression is that solar in particular is frequently bumping into the limits of physics and chemistry and that incremental increases in efficiency require a great deal of investment. This argument makes much more sense to me when applied to wind power, which seems decidedly less complex.

If we're going to play the evidence game, let's find some actual contributions that photovoltaics has made or is likely to make to fields of inquiry outside of itself.  Nuclear research has, to start with, given us medical and industrial radiography, medical and food sterilization methods, significant developments in powder metallurgy, and played a critical role in the foundation of scientific computing."

"U3 unemployment only tells one part of the story.  The (supposed) need for skilled labor has caused a huge surge in people looking to fill those skilled positions, but as these positions do not exist in adequate number, we have a large number of underemployed.

If low skill employment were better compensated (that is, unemployment remained under 5% long enough for wages to climb) then less people would seek an education and be willing to work these positions and we would have less underemployed.

Immigration suppresses wages at the lower end (and the study linked in the article even admits this), but without sufficient growth in high-skill sectors, there's no net benefit."

Notably, these judges do not point to the cannabis prosecutions and  say that they're why the problem exists.  Nor do they point to them and say that they're part of why the problem exists.  What they do is point to systemic issues of all kinds of cases taking far, far too long to reach a resolution.  Stop all cannabis prosecutions and this problem doesn't go away because it's far, far larger.

The author on the other hand as an agenda to push: cannabis legalization.  This is a separate issue and I suspect driven by what I suspect might be the author's frustration that the Trudeau Liberals promised to legalize marijuana and have so far not done so leaving all the cannabis laws in place."

"Whoa! * *Keanu Reeves' voice* * Your mom is flawless! &lt;3 Her routine seems awesome too.
I get so jealous whenever I hear people talking about their parents having a skincare routine. My mom literally washes her face with dirty handsoap and never wore sunscreen until last year when I basically forced her to. When I gave her the bottle she said ""Ok, so... do I eat it or...?"" She's 60 and has perfect, plump skin though, so she can get away with it. "

"Follow sites like Mixergys model. Andrew has done a great job of charging for content that is free on a lot of other sites. They're are literally hundreds/thousands of other business podcast but he is charging people monthly for his. 

The problem with mixergy is there becomes so much content that it is overwhelming to find what you need. Then read the transcript or listen to the interview can all become too much to find what you are looking. And Andrew has become kind of annoying in the past few years so I stopped listening to him

"&gt; it's stance on GMO's is not based on evidence

It actually is. It is just not evidence of safety. What tipped the EU towards where it is was they reproduced the research that demonstrated the great benefits of GMO. What they found was that the corporate claims did not pan out. GMO wasn't doing any better than what the EU already uses.

In that context they made the decision that 0 benefit is worth precisely 0 risk (and we have no long term evidence one way or the other about risks. The EU does not assume safety until demonstrated otherwise).

If another GMO crop is put forward the EU will again rerun the research and judge it based upon the results they see. The corporations aren't contesting it too strongly because they really do not want the EU redoing all their research and highlighting where the reality differs from the published claims.

The real problem is the technology is just not ready. The current state of GMO crops is outcomes that sit within error margins of what is already in use. The technology is being pushed out prematurely because of the length of patent grants rather than because the technology is actually at a point where it is useful."

"I have to agree that Massdrop is late to come to the k-beauty market when their are already so many inroads being made by other companies. They should really be thinking about first mover advantage in terms of business strategy. In terms of market share, they may not be making any significant gains. IE Market leader(with vision) or market follower(playing catch-up in a crowded market).  

I agree that they should be branching off into non-Korean beauty with an emphasis on Japanese beauty. Japan seems like a somewhat closed/difficult market for reach into the international community due to their marketing strategy and language barriers. I suspect it has something to do with the age of their work force. I've read a news article where younger generations complain about entrenched company culture of baby boomers/age hierarchy. Versus the mass innovation with new companies that came after WWII, it's become more difficult for new companies to emerge due to stagnation. IE not a lot of change/innovation.  As an offshoot of that mentality, I don't see a lot of international marketing for smaller niche companies, unlike large brands like Shiseido, or Shu Uemura. But their is demand and interest as seen with some Japanese products. The only issue I see is not enough reviews of lesser known Japanese products (knowledge) that would seed growth.  "

"Tax reform? Let's make it simple and unavoidable; and send poor Pigou to the scrap heap. Just get the money; then spend it is accountable ways. Tax bads, not goods? Well, making the tax system impenetrable seems to me a pretty profound 'bad'. 

Societies have four deterrents to undesirable behaviour: rationing it, applying a social stigma, making it illegal or slapping a tax on it. None of those work perfectly, and all of them come with overheads. Tax is one of the easiest responses, and the outcome has been a proliferation of silly little taxes, and of their evil cousin, tax allowances. 

There is a case for deterrent taxes on activities which in excess are socially undesirable, such as alcohol. We should simply ban cigarettes, but prefer to tax them out of political cowardice. Most industrial countries closely manage firearms, except for some well known anomalies, which pay for this with a high murder rate. Carbon, though: that is problematic. 

Energy is notoriously price inelastic. Inter-fuel substitution is sensitive to price differentials - coal and gas in power generation, say - but you don't need a clunky carbon tax to bring that about. Just mandate a future fuel portfolio. Energy intensity has fallen in almost all industrial countries. That has had very little to do with energy prices - change proceeding at a steady pace whilst prices yo-yo around - and has rather been due to efficient equipment, changes in the sector base of industry and the trade in embodied energy. Once again, mandating efficiency standards has had far more impact than price, whether taxed or not.

"The great investors/traders know how to filter signals from noisy market signals. There's nothing wrong with taking partial profits at certain levels, but it depends on your investment philosophy and reason for entering a position. Me personally, I use monthly charts for entering and exiting position. I look at support/resistance levels and don't exit a position until it breaks through a certain support level on high volume. I can end up giving back my profits but long term success depends on having the discipline to follow your system no matter what. For AMD and other positions, I look at the price action around the 10 week moving average. The big money players try to get stocks at their cheapest price so they will usually wait until it drops to this support level to add more to their portfolio. If the institutions are not jumping in to buy on weakness then that's usually a signal that something is wrong. "

&gt; Further out, there are several proposals related to flex caps or incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls based on allowing miners to produce larger blocks at some cost. These proposals help preserve the alignment of incentives between miners and general node operators, and prevent defection between the miners from undermining the fee market behavior that will eventually fund security. I think that right now capacity is high enough and the needed capacity is low enough that we don't immediately need these proposals, but they will be critically important long term. I'm planning to help out and drive towards a more concrete direction out of these proposals in the following months.

&gt; Adam and Greg have a responsibility to their investors to try to follow through with their business plan

Those investors have agreed to contracts that give the developers at blockstream complete independence. E.g. they can quit at any time and receive another full year of salary if there's disagreement about the direction to go in. They have also timelocked away substantial amounts of bitcoin as an incentive to increase the networks value. After all, blockstream was created by bitcoin developers as a way to fund bitcoin development. It's not some external entity that managed to grasp control of the project.

&gt; This relies on Segwit. Without Segwit it won't work.

"Well, if you buy the 3 ETFs listed in the CCP one then you probably have enough diversification there.

The reason I mention the limits is that it's easy to lose some money but then decide things are 'down' so you should buy more, so you top that account back up.

Or it's easy to make some money and decide to either add more (because you're doing so well), or to 'let it ride'. Letting it ride is fine if that's your plan, but it's easy to end up holding things for longer than you planned because you don't want to sell while they're going up.

As long as your $11k is your 'safe' money then having $2k of 'fun money' is fine, and can even help protect you against making adjustments to the safe money."

"It would be completely accurate if the blocksize increase is a flat amount like 2mb.  That's a big part of why those proposals stalled - they don't actually solve the problem.

However, it isn't true that a consistent block size increase would be the same thing.  Technological improvements/infrastructure expansions are driving the cost of operating a node down by about 8-18% a year, so at a minimum that amount can be supported.  Further than that though, as the Bitcoin price increases, and as economic activity increases, transaction fees priced in dollars increase drastically and rapidly, but the costs of operating a node (without scaling) stays flat or decreases.  In about 3-5 years it will cost less to run a node for a month than it will to send a single transaction.  That's broken - We need to change how we think about the costs of operating nodes and price node resource costs in terms of Bitcoin, not dollars.  Currently that's about 0.01 btc per month which seems like a pretty balanced point to me, but it is declining rapidly now that tx/s are capped.

Edit: Roughly 0.01 BTC/month, not 0.001.  Calculated from cloud hosting bandwidth and storage costs, assuming processing to be a comparative nonissue."

"I worked for Jetstar for about ~2 years, and can completely understand where you're coming from.

If what you've booked is a stater fare, you aren't entitled to a refund or voucher to the same effect. You'll only be able to change the dates of travel or change the passenger names which either incurs a change fee PLUS the difference in fare between the one you booked and the new flight.

Playing hardball with Jetstar will see no benefit as call centre agents simply don't have authority to move things around, and managers will deny all requests on the spot. If you don't pay the change fee(s), then you'll just have to forfeit the cost of the tickets.

If you ever fly Jetstar again I stress to you and everyone else to book a flexi-ticket! The cheep starter fare is very enticing, I know, but not worth the pain if you ever have to change or cancel the booking."

"A good answer: Masksheets.com was selling LLang Self Clinic 3 Step Kit (Pore-Control, Brightening, or Moisturizing) for $1 each in their dollar sale section. That's basically as good as you'll get. The 3 Steps began with a 6% AHA swab, then an ampoule, and ending with a face mask. However, it's now OOS but you can ask to see if they'll restock.

A better answer: Honestly, I think that the ""cotton swab trend"" was just a gimmick. Was it kind of cool seeing all the gunk on the cotton swab? Yeah. But I think a regular cotton pad would work just as well along with Cosrx AHA or some other AHA product. Then I would probably follow up with  mask(s) that targets your concerns - acne/redness/brightening/hydrating. If you're really into cotton swabs, you can try out It's Skin Clear Skin Peeling Swab (but I again I think cotton pad is more cost efficient in the long run).

Cult favs are for mainly redness/acne: Benton Snail Bee Sheet Mask, Tosowoong Pure Propolis Mask, Tosowoong Green Tea Sheet Mask, Leaders Amino AC Free Mask, MBD Imperial Bird's Nest, MBD Strawberry Yogurt, MBD Apple Polyphenol, MBD Arbutin, MBD Black Pearl, LJH TeaTree Soothing

I too was in a similar position. Here is my post regarding it https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/5vcunz/what_to_do_in_an_overbought_market/

The solution I have chosen is simple. Made a STP and investing the amount over an extended period. My reasoning is simple.

1. I am a salaried person. My job takes most of my time. I don't have enough knowledge about the market to know when it will go up or down nor do I have the time to do detailed research. Whatever research I do, I find conflicting views of experts, some say the market will go up some say it will go down. In reality, no one knows. 

2. The whole point of an MF is to offload the worrying to the Fund Manager, that is why we pay them.

3. We can lose money both by holding it and by investing as well. So the safest, hassle and tension free and possibly the most prudent way is to do STP.

4. The biggest advantage of STP is peace of mind. I am not glued to the screen every day to see how the markets are doing.

Selling the news brought us to .0039. And I think only about 1 million shares traded today were from retail investors who's dumped. There was probably another 1 million retail of buy. The other 9ish was in the .0047 to .0040/50 range. Which appears to be an arranged conversion.

Fact of the matter is, we are moving to a cashless society with bank apps getting better.

Do you have a background in business?

The same holds with Penny stocks.  If you go all in, you may win big.  But chances are that you are going to lose.

"Well first of all (quick rebuttals, i'm on my phone), male hormone is not illegal. My grandfather is on testosterone replacement through OHIP.

Second of all, there is a good reason why you can't get other forms of male hormone. It's very damaging. Plus, progesterone isn't great for a male to have in large quantities. Hormones aren't magical drugs. They can be dangerous and damaging. See: the 20th century breast cancer epidemic from female hormone replacement.

Male hormones don't work for male contraception as they have way too high of risks.

Men can easily get birth control through condoms, spermicides, or have the women use diaphragms, female condoms, cervical caps... There are many options out there.

"Initial reaction (brace yourself):  yuck.  The whole intro blurb is corporate doublespeak, which is fine if you're working with corporations, but I have no idea what the business does.  Custom solutions in software?  Graphic design?  Product design? What the heck do you actually do that you want to customize for me?

Same thing with your ""passions"".  I've scrolled down quite a ways and I have no idea what you're selling that you are so passionate about.

If I were an actual client I would have moved on before ever getting to Services.  That needs to be moved above the (trendy but fairly useless) passions.

Okay, now at Services.  Data analytics--you do data science?  Really big data?  That's what it sounds like.  But then I see web and mobile solutions, which makes me think you do web design.  If so, with all the real estate you've used up getting me here, including the batch of slick but uninformative images I just had to scroll through, I'd be thinking twice about your design capabilities.

Next I see marketing.  If your website is an example, I'm re-thinking my plans a lot, since it's been like pulling teeth to see what you're selling, and this is your flagship site!

Under your client examples, the large striped b&amp;w image at the top hurts my eyes.  Cutting edge is great, but blinding stripes beneath each client name is too much.  At least grey it out some.

On the Vertex slide show, the Vertex logo is hard to read over the image, and on the initial slide the white lettering overprints the edge of the screen in the image and other white lettering on the screen image, making it hard to read.  I'm liable to skip it anyhow because it's wordy and from the front page I know I'll be seeing business-speak cliches.

Frankly it's that way on all your examples.  Try either putting an opaque box beneath the text and over the image, or separate the text and images entirely.

On About, your pics are unflattering, except for Mark.  Lauren you look like you have a bump on your forehead and the coloration is just off;  not enough contrast (except for Stuart, where there's too much) and they're all a bit dark (on iPad).

And there's no phone number anywhere?  

Sorry to make this sound as awful as it probably does, but it's really not a great site.

From what I've experienced, car insurance companies do auto-renewals (I pay annually):

* &gt;Normally they're roll on to the next year with a renewal quote unless you tell them you want to cancel.
This caught me off guard from my insurance company, as I assumed I could cancel online. Turns out only option I had was to phone them directly to cancel. 

* &gt;have sent you plenty of reminders and notifications that they were going to renew your policy. 
True, always check your registered email. Sometimes they even phone you and offer package deals as you get closer to renewal.

* &gt;14 days of receiving documentation about the renewal you're in then you're in the cooling off period This could vary depending on company policy. 
Cancelled my old insurance within 7 days upon getting better deal w/ another company. Previous company refunded my money in full amount.

However, in your case I'm not quite sure if it had passed or not passed **cooling off period**. Maybe have a read on their policies (there might be some discrepancies w/c you can challenge).

but on any level, I think many have already accepted that governments may try to limit encryption, but that often ends up being something that never passes the media. 

If I remember correctly, the British gov did the rounds in 2010-2012 about stopping encryption for personal use and the general response they got was having it pointed out that they would also be susceptible and it would be borderline impossible for them to be fully excluded, which changed the tone somewhat.

Colloquially, the idea of identity politics is often used as a pejorative descriptor  of social liberalism, the Left, the progressive movement, and/or the Democratic party. The view is that liberals seek to gain support by appealing to demographic groups such as African American, the LGBT community, immigrants, religious minorities, young people, etc. However, it is argued that conservatives are guilty of this same tactic by appealing to social traditionalists, rural people, whites, Christians, older people, etc. "

+ the employer can provide unsafe offices, lock doors, not bother with fire alarms, fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, clean aisles, unblocked staircases, basically storing their work in progress and waste wherever they feel like it, or cram too many people into a room

I mean, that has repeatedly been shown to provide the cheapest prices.

Thiokol said that they could not recommend a launch at that temperature. NASA asked them to reconsider. Thiokol management essentially overruled the engineers and said they were okay with a launch. NASA asked for that in writing, which was not typical procedure. The fact that NASA asked for that in writing means to me that NASA knew it was a big risk and that Thiokol management was putting themselves on the line. Should the engineers have had a better presentation to their management? Possibly, but it seems like Thiokol management knew the risk and made the decision to green light the launch anyway. It wasn't a new issue, Thiokol management knew cold O-rings were a problem.

"I don't disagree with you on how people *should* communicate with others regarding controversial topics but I have to acknowledge that it's key issues that gravitate someone to be liberal or conservative. These are long-standing problems that are difficult to not hear ""all sides of.""

Key issues include contraceptive rights, homosexuality/same-sex marriage, climate change, gun reform. The first three are pretty one-sided in the scientific community.

------------

Scientists are very quick to adopt new ideas if enough evidence is presented to support it. One example is that roughly 70 years ago scientists believed that proteins were genetic material (as opposed to DNA/RNA). It wasn't until experiments like [Hersey-Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey%E2%80%93Chase_experiment) that change this. There was some grumbling initially I'm sure, but it was readily adopted.

Reactionary groups, conservatives, however, are by definition, conservative. Readily adopting new ideas when presented evidence is not their strength (see Galileo). This isn't bad per se, as it forces those who are presenting evidence to find more convincing data and helps snuff out false conclusions (like the [arsenic/DNA fiasco](http://www.nature.com/news/arsenic-life-bacterium-prefers-phosphorus-after-all-1.11520) from 2010)"

"Pre-pubescent children don't really ""transition"". Medically, there's not much to do. Whether trans or not, children should be able to express themselves, play with whatever toys, etc. Forcing gender roles on them is harmful to their wellbeing. The best way to help kids figure themselves out is through education. Let them know what their options are, and that whatever they choose is fine, though it is an important decision to be thought about. Once they reach their pre-teens or so, if they aren't sure that they want to start puberty yet, they can be given hormone blockers to give them some more time. If they really want it, hormone therapy can be started around their early teens."
"Semi-evidence? I am the coordinator for teen pregnancy prevention at a community health center in MA. We have seen the use of LARCs (specifically nexplanon) increase in our teen female population by about 17-20% each year (meaning, when a 12-19 year old comes in seeking birth control, the amount that choose a LARC over a short acting option like BCPs increases by about that amount yearly). As such our teen birth rate has decreased by about 13% yearly, but our teen rate of chlamydia has increased by about 30% and syphilis (surprising!) by about 4%. Now, this could be partially due to increased utilization of our family planning clinic so we are just seeing more patients in general, but it is potentially influenced by decreases in condom use. An in-house small survey DID seem to indicate that girls with LARCs were more willing to engage in sex without a barrier method. "
"&gt;but all I'm really seeing are plans to stop government funding for them.

Then you aren't following the debate. Laws have been written to redefine life so killing a fetus (having an abortion) would be a criminal offense as well as writing laws to shut down safe clinics that provide abortions by forcing doctors to have admitting privileges among other additional unnecessary regulation. 

https://rewire.news/article/2017/01/23/republicans-push-deeply-unpopular-personhood-bill-congress/

&gt;So-called personhood laws, a favorite tactic of anti-choice activists for decades, seek to classify fertilized eggs, zygotes, embryos, and fetuses as ‚Äúpersons,‚Äù and to grant them full legal protection under the U.S. Constitution, including the right to life from the moment of conception. If enacted, the laws would criminalize abortion with no exception and ban many forms of contraception, in vitro fertilization, and health care for pregnant people.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Senate_Bill_5

&gt;Texas Senate Bill 5 is a list of measures that would amend and add to abortion regulations in Texas. These measures include a ban on abortion at 20 weeks post-fertilization and recognize that the state has a compelling interest to protect fetuses from pain.[2] **The bill would mandate that a doctor who performs abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital**, and to require that clinics meet the same standards as other surgical health-care facilities in the state.[3][4][5][6] Another provision would require oversight of women taking abortion-inducing drugs such as RU-486.[7] The bill would not apply to abortions necessary to save the mother's life or to prevent permanent bodily damage from a pregnancy.


You said 

&gt;and I think it's wrong to make the general public pay for people's mistakes. 

This makes no sense unless you think an abortion is less expensive then sending a kid to public school? In the U.S. we spend over 10k per student per year. Meaning over 100k to the tax payers for every child.

https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66

&gt;Total expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools in the United States amounted to $620 billion in 2012‚Äì13, or $12,296 per public school student enrolled in the fall.

If you are concerned with paying for ""people's mistakes"" you should really be anti-public education. Of course then you have bigger problems like a population of people more ignorant than you."
"&gt;not to try and squeeze as much money out of their employers as possible.

The irony of this statement is almost too much to bear, but I'll continue regardless. 

The point of a union is to form a power bloc that cannot be exploited as easily as a single person can be. Solidarity in the workplace to prevent the misuse of (illegitimate) power that the business owners hold. 

This advances in stages, as the power of capital is gradually curtailed until the workers and producers are the ones who decide how the fruits of their labour are distributed. The ultimate goal is the democratic control of all workplaces by all workers. "

CARA is so promising because their pain relieving drugs are non-addictive. Through trials they have shown to have zero effects in regards to the high feeling or euphoria experienced when taking opioids (codeine, oxycodone, etc). The trials compared a placebo to their CR845 and the subjects showed there was no difference between the placebo and their drug as far as positive euphoria/addictive qualities. That's huge. Doctors are so reluctant to prescribe pain meds because they are so addictive. With CR845, doctors won't need to worry about addiction. That's HUGE."

"&gt; To argue for less state is to argue for more of the individual

""We"" are not the State; the State is not ""us"". The State may to an extent represent our communal, hierarcical nature, but those within the State (i.e, a legislative body with a monopoly on the use of force) are apart from, and parasitic upon, the rest. Not everything 'natural' is beneficial (relative to alternatives).

&gt; the individual itself is meaningless like a finger without a hand without an arm without a torso without a neck without a head.

The individual without community is like a body without limbs; the individual without Statism is like a body without a tumour.

&gt; Humans come together and form communities, the modern state is the community manifested.

Was totalitarian communism ""community manifested""? Was absolute monarchy? ""Communities"" can manifest themselves in different ways. Some are more shit than others. 

&gt; They'll give you an argument based solely on money but can they make an argument based on the communitarian benefits? No.

This fkn straw-man. I posted an article and highlighted this quote: ""Even if it were the case that one‚Äôs real income would rise as a result of immigration, it does not follow that immigration must be considered ‚Äúgood,‚Äù for material wealth is not the only thing that counts. Rather, what constitutes ‚Äúwelfare‚Äù and ‚Äúwealth‚Äù is subjective, and one might prefer lower material living standards and a greater distance from certain other people to higher material living standards and a smaller distance.""

I anticipated well.

Austro-libertarians in particular emphasise subjectivism. Austro-libertarians in particular lean conservative - family, church, local business, etc.

&gt; If you make money from free trade how does it benefit all of the community? It's in the interest of the community to keep money within it as much as possible.

Well, this will have to be demonstrated. Not everything necessarily has an evolutionary advantage. Take pubic hair for example. As far as I have read, there doesn't seem to be any survival benefit to pubic hair.

&gt;but in a world without science, the data were limited to sensory experience.

Erm, in a world **with** science the data is still limited to sensory experience. We can extend our senses, for example when we use infra red telescopes. But in that case the data still has to be translated into a format that we can perceive - false colour images.

&gt;The most important point is that SUPERSTITIONS ARE INTUITIVE

I disagree. Agent detection is intuitive. So thinking that some kind of mind is responsible for lightening is intuitive. But thinking that the owner of this mind is called Zeus &amp; he slept with a mortal named Alcmene to father Heracles - how is any of this intuitive?

&gt;The great triumph of science has been to transcend intuition

I disagree again. There is a very famous lecture by Richard Feynman where he says that every hypothesis starts with a guess. Where does this guess come from if not intuition? It's better informed intuition, but intuition nonetheless.

"That will suck for Republicans, but it will be huge opporunity for liberals to re-shape America since the GOPs dreams of governing are just turning into horrible approval ratings.

They've easily pissed off enough people to lose seatss already and they have 3+ years to go! The first couple months should be among the easiest and least controversial. 

Since Republicans can't represent the people, once they get power like this, they fail rapidly. 

Those executive branches only realistically do so much. They are most watered down oversight that has no teeth. Even the EPA can't seem to enforce it's own policies into law. Lots of places operate in violation of the EPA, so while they mean well, they don't actually do a ton of good from a management perspective, or at least they only do the good that the President at any given time wants. 

In some ways they force every President to try to reshape education, drug approval, environmental impact, because for some reason we think the President should have direct say over those things.. I don't know what. 

Places like the EPA and FDA should be outside of the executive branch in the first place because every administration flip flops on what they should be doing, which probably does waste a lot of money.

The FCC is probably one of the most powerful of those branches and while they probably won't get rid of it, it would probably be better if the President did not have direct control of media regulation without congressional consent of any kind. 

Reagan used the FCC to help US media monopolize to a huge degree. We went from 50+ major media outlets to 16 under Reagan. That's probably the most consolidation of media in any one Presidency and they did it through the FCC.

The difference then was Reagan was likable and Trump just isn't. Having a figure head lead your organization that a majority of people dislike is almost always a recipe for failure and Trump is living up to that quite well.

Keep motivating liberals Bannon. I love it! With Bush people would just angry, surprised and disappointed. This time they are angry, feeling betrayed and looking for blood. "

"First question - 

good question. i don't think that it would be possible or beneficial to lower the blocksize to 1kb. however i don't see that raising the limit to 2MB solves anything longterm. And raising it again and again is not a solution. Scaling is too complicated to possible consider this a solution.

Second question - 

there is no coherency here. core are not dictating anything. this is not monolithic. they make code. BU make code. i use core's code. that's not how dictatorship works."

"I've lived in Copenhagen for a while. F√∏tex is pretty big. It's comparable to American supermarkets like Ralph's and those. But yeah, Fakta and Netto are pretty small. We don't have anything like that in the states really. Maybe some family-owned grocery stores."
"In terms of priorities, I think the one that deserves to be highest or near the top is the maintenance of America as a land of opportunity, a place where any citizen, regardless of background (race, location, skills, etc), can achieve the basic American dream: a house, a car, food, education and healthcare if they are willing to work for it. 

This has to take a backseat to supremacy and the desire to be #1 at everything. Having the biggest GDP, army, etc should be less important than providing the basics for everyone, first and foremost. Those dicksize contests and powergrabs are the reason we're in this mess in the first place. Forget about making America ""great"", how about we start by making it ""good"" first? 65+ year olds working two jobs just so they can pay their medical bills, veterans who have to count pennies, inner city families who can barely feed themselves. We've got major problems with lack of access to the basics that need fixing before we move on to becoming the best and the greatest. 

I may sound like a socialist but I don't intend to. Instead of left or right, we just need common sense in government. Yes, deregulation and simplification of government has its place in this as much as a strong social safety net does. There needs to be a proper balance, and due to the rightward shift that we've had since the 80's, we achieve true balance by moving left a little bit on most issues, and moving right a little on a few others. 

It's highly ironic that the people we elect to office sell themselves to corporations so they can raise money to show us stupid attack ads on TV and influence us into voting for them. It's like having your wife go and fuck other men in an effort to become more desirable to you. For most people (except for exceptions) that's infidelity and it's the wrong approach. Politics is quite literally cucked (notice the lack of quotes). Look at Cory Booker and his pharma industry influenced vote, for example. Sure he raised some money to buy votes, but at what cost? We're lucky he got caught due to an enlightened populace. 

For me personally, Bernie embodies this prioritization, so he's a good leader for a new party. We'd be accepting the status quo and blaming Iraq/Mexico/China/Russia/Republicans/Democrats for our fate and never looking inward or having these conversations if he didn't exist. But I get what you're saying about how the vision comes before the leadership because people are fallible but ideas are not and people only last a generation but ideas live on. "

"He's actually got a point; a lot of white collar jobs are going to be automated out of existence, or outsourced to places with low-paid but well-educated people - China or India, for instance, whereas something like plumbing will remain relatively labour intensive and impossible to transfer overseas, because it has geographical limits on where the employment can take place.

If ALL you want from university is a ticket that gives you a decent-paying job, then going for trades in plumbing, vehicle maintenance, construction or whatever might be sound advice. If you have cravings for education, knowledge or a specific career path, then uni will probably still be the proper course..."

"That is pretty much it, however, there is more to it than that: antenna size, etc., all come into play.

Fundamentally, electricity through a wire or over the air is the same, however, in a wire the electric field follows the cable (with some losses). You can direct an electric field with an antenna (like a microwave dish) but there is still spread and a lot depends on the size of the TX and RX antennas.

In any event, it used to be a standard thing for tech focused kids to make a crystal radio. All a crystal radio does is receive a radio signal and ""convert"" it to electricity which moves the speaker. That is wireless power transfer.

Of course radio is electricity, just electricity that doesn't travel through a wire."

"That is not ""consistent underfilling"". Most of their blocks are full to the rim.

As I observed above, [backlogs are not permanent](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/30d.html).  Part of the time, the incoming traffic is less than 1 MB every 10 minutes.  At those times, blocks **must** be less than 1 MB. If you zoom into the lowest parts of that plot (drag the mouse) you will see those blocks: they occur around those times that the backlog drops to ~1 MB or less.  (The plot does not go all the way down to zero because the sampling points are spaced at equal intervals, so they don't coincide with the block finding times.)

And very short interblock intervals occur often too, when the next block must be empty because the lucky miner did not have time to fill it. 

But, anyway, the miners have the ""right"" to mine anyway they want.  The incentives, not some sort of ""moral imperative"", are supposed to spur them to do what Satoshi intended.   If a miner does not do what you would like him to do, that is a failure of the protocol, not a ""sin"" by the miner.

"&gt; Firstly, the US Pres does not control the country in the same was as our PM does. Congress can really screw over an administration, and show that the Pres doesn't really control things, unless Congress allows it.

That is my argument - Congress is doing nothing to stop him. In fact, there is every indication that they support him. The republican members of congress have had plenty of chances to denounce any of the executive orders he has signed, introduce legislation to overturn them, or vote against his choices for cabinet. They have done none of this. Checks and balances mean nothing when actions aren't taken.

&gt; Secondly, Trump is extremely unpopular, and while that may not result in impeachment, it still means that Congress is likely to try and divorce themselves from him so that the House doesn't go Blue in 2018.

"In the story, God used Abraham's willingness to show that it wasn't necessary. The two things are not at odds. Another clue in the text is that Abraham told the man at the bottom of the mountain that they would both be back, making it probable that he never believed that God would allow it to happen.  Also, if Isaac was supposed to be the son of the promise that God made to Abraham, Isaac was in no position to die. The idea that he would actually be sacrificed makes no narrative sense. Again, none of this should matter anyway if you believe none of these people lived and doubt the veracity of the story entirely."

"Right but that would also generate a ton of debt (you think the deficit is bad now conservatives?) and it would take a lot of time before the growth would kick in. Long term, CIT cuts and their deficit impact would be mitigated, but it would be a significant expense in the short term.

Also, as much as I personally would love to radically raise immigration levels, I know it would take politically obscene levels of funding and debt to pull it off, especially if you wanted the processing to be done in a timely fashion. 

It's possible, but is the conservative party going to back such a hypothetical plan in pursuit of 3%? How long are they willing to wait for benefits to kick in while the deficit is $100+B? The benefits wouldn't really kick in until KOL retired from politics. Conservatives have shown a willingness to run up the debt south of the border, and perhaps an election victory is all it would take here too, but I don't see it atm.

"&gt;You are asking ""Is it normal for the average person who drops out of HS for any reason to get a $40 an hour job"" Which the answer is no.

Correct.

But that is the right way to think about it in the context of my question.  That context being in reply to somebody using anecdotal evidence.

&gt;ut that's not what is being stated, and that is ""Is it normal for the average person who drops out of HS for a job to get paid near $40 an hour"".

"So in the end only just under 4000 sites were affected? I wonder why it's only those ones and not more, given the large volume of sites they serve?

Edit: here is a good explanation from hacker news :

""&gt; The greatest period of impact was from February 13 and February 18 with around 1 in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests through Cloudflare potentially resulting in memory leakage (that‚Äôs about 0.00003% of requests).

1) From the metrics I recalled when I interviewed there, and assuming the given probability is correct, that means a potential of 100k-200k paged with private data leaked every day.

2) What's the probably that a page is served to a cache engine? Not a clue. Let's assume 1/1000.

3) That puts a bound around a hundred leaked pages saved per day into caches.

4) Do the cache only provide the latest version of a page? I think most do but not all. Let's ignore that aspect.

5) What's the probably that a page contains private user information like auth tokens? Maybe 1/10?

6) So, that's 10 pages saved per day into the internet search caches.

7) That's on par with their announcement: ""With the help of Google, Yahoo, Bing and others, we found 770 unique URIs that had been cached and which contained leaked memory. Those 770 unique URIs covered 161 unique domains."" Well, not that we know for how long this was running.

8) Now, I don't want to downplay the issue, but leaking an dozen tokens per day is not that much of a disaster. Sure it's bad, but it's not remotely close to the leak of the millennia and it's certainly not internet scale leak.

9) For the record, CloudFlare serves over one BILLION human beings. Given the tone and the drama I expected way more data from this leak. 

This is a huge disappointment.
Happy Ending: You were probably not affected.""

Even this referenced issue wasn't reproducible by most of the devs for Edge so it would seem Microsoft's recommendation is the safer alternative (despite being a joke that you should upgrade your OS to fix a bug.)

I suspect if there were easy/reliable means of exploiting the two separate CFG checks that Microsoft would have patched it sooner.  Even still, 7 days for a behemoth software team to turn around a fix without breaking other shit is a fair request.

"I agree with the other commenters that this a big red flag. Even if things get back on track the chances working at this company further will be a strong career move is probably quite low.

One other thing I would suggest. I'm not in the States so not sure how things work there but in my country tax is actually deducted before your salary is paid. The employer/company then makes a bulk payment of all employees' tax to the Revenue Authorities. It sometimes happens here that when companies are collapsing the management uses the money they should be paying as employee tax to cover other obligations.

It usually takes the government quite a while to realise this is happening and so if the company does fail the employees sometimes discover that their taxes weren't paid for the last couple months without their knowledge. They end up being personally liable to the govt. but able to file civil suit against the company for not paying them on their behalf - which isn't really much help at all.

Obviously this isn't legal advice or something - just worth checking with the IRS that everything is up to date if this is how taxes work in your situation!

Also: good work on the paper trail, always worth doing."

Blair never lost a general election. He didn't lose Scotland. He wasn't responsible for strategy in 2010 and 2015. He's been out of political life for almost 10 years now...

I think the points you raise are somewhat important and contribute a small part to Labour's electoral failure over the last two GEs but the responsibility lies with Miliband / Balls IMO. They couldn't keep Scotland Red and not only that they failed to convince constituencies in England like Broxtowe to vote Labour. 

I may be overreaching here, but the loss of Scotland in particular may have just been out of their hands. That the forces unleashed in 2014 after the referendum changed Scottish political life so dramatically practically overnight that there was no hope for Labour even if they played their perfect hand.

"That's interesting. In SF there has been a noticeable decline of the driver supply in UberPOOL, but I still use it 95%+ of the time. However, I believe that if Uber had to raise prices, the supply of drivers on UberPOOL would increase again. Drivers might rebel against the fare, but Uber is setting the fare (probably knowingly), and they probably do so because currently, riders will choose to use UberX instead of a cab or competitor. Unfortunately this pattern does work a bit like Wal-Mart, where Uber only has to provide service as cheap as the market requires it to.

I also know that riders reporting one passenger on POOL and then trying to board with two is a problem. I'm not sure what they should do about this."

"The present situation with healthcare in America reminds me of something Churchill once said: ""We can always count on Americans to do the right thing- after they've exhausted every other possibility."" Most, if not all, major industrialized countries besides the United States have, to some degree, nationalized their healthcare systems and achieved universal coverage while doing so. The author of this article does a good job at pointing out the failures of the free market in health care, which I think our leaders would do well to  recognize and thereby move us to a system that actually makes sense.

"I think you're confusing the **concept** of decentralization itself with the **utility** of decentralization via an implementation. I've already inferred it, but I will emphasize that the concept of decentralization does not have any inherent utility without some sort of implementation.

It's true that a means of protection/utility can be brought up and empowered by decentralization, (all depending on the implementation), however, the concept of decentralization in and of itself is not necessarily equal to protection, or even utility in general.

In its most simple form, the concept of decentralization of a network is running a network across multiple different computers. Then, BY DEFINITION, running your own node means that part of the bitcoin network now runs on your computer, further decentralizing the network.

It's important to note I'm talking about decentralization here as a concept. Not as utility, or a tool, or political/economic power, or anything else.

If you want to start talking about the utility gained from running a node, that's an entirely different subject. The main utility of running your own node simply means that you can validate your own transactions without having to trust any 3rd party, however there are other various uses, such as wanting to mess around with code itself, etc.

Not everything everyone does has to have an ulterior motive. It's not like every person running a node is doing so with the specific intent of gaining political power within bitcoin. I think running a node for fun, or simply to say you support the concept of decentralization are valid enough reasons without having to go any deeper."

"Yes, but for Trump's immigration ban to hold water, it would need to be substantially different from his original ban. The problem with this ban is that Trump essentially just swapped a few words and said ""OK, this one isn't a Muslim ban"". The Judiciary looked at it, saw that it was effectively identical to the previous, discriminatory ban, and determined that the intent was the same. If a new ban is to be passed, it would have to be distinct from the old ban in ways that show that the intent is *not* discrimination. Now, that's a fairly high bar, but given how much of a blatantly discriminatory clusterfuck the *first* attempt at a ban was, I'm OK with the Judiciary forcing the Executive branch to adhere to a high standard."

"&gt; As someone who uses bitcoin as it was intended (p2p cash)

That isn't what Bitcoin can be used for in the long term, sorry.  Satoshi got it wrong, Satoshi wasn't an expert in large scale computing systems, just economics.

Math: 426 billion non-cash transactions worldwide in 2015 = 4.8 GB blocks = 250 terabytes of storage every year*($8,000 in just hard drives)* = 2 Gbit/s bandwidth*(1/5th of a typical whole datacenter 10G fiber feed, $33,000 a month in data charges using EC2 pricing)*.  All of that is just to run a **single** node.  At current growth rates we'd reach that in 14-17 years and we exhaust the largest current proposals(8gb +SW) **within 5 years**.  Worldwide tx growth*(+8-10%/y)* is not far behind bandwidth*(-8% to -18%/y)* and hard drive*(-14%/y)* price decreases, and our tx growth*(65%-80%/y)* is vastly exceeding both, so technological improvements won't save us from our own growth.

You might think those numbers are a long ways off, but they aren't.  A full node on default settings today consumes 1.5 TB/mo of bandwidth; To put that in perspective, the U.S. nationwide Comcast bandwidth cap is 1TB, and many users in Australia can no longer run a full node with default peers on their broadband connection, it isn't fast enough."

"&gt;&gt; Why smaller wages?

&gt;Do you really think that Tories, who are leading Brexit, who - by and large - are business owners/company shareholders themselves, or are directly tied into executive boards etc. (therefore: have their own interest in keeping as much profit as they can and share as little as they can with whoever is further down the ladder); the same people who already are talking about making UK a ""tax haven"" (hint: that means ""benefits for corporations"", not for working people), are going to be so generous to provide legal framework to increase the national minimum wage

They are increasing the national minimum wage. Or is that an EU thing? I can't remember now. 

It also doesn't negate any of the reasoning I laid out.

Either way it's besides the point isn't it? We are talking about brexit not the Tories. 

&gt;when there's no watchdog in place regulating how little people can be paid, how many hours can they work etc. - with a free reign to pass whatever law they please to protect *their own* bottom line?

The watchdog is the law. We can make our own laws, you know the people who are elected to do so? Who's watching the EU to make sure they do stuff right? It's such a narrow minded argument and again not much to do with the economy after brexit. 

&gt;It's speculation at this point - everything is on either of the sides in fact, I'll give you that (which is one of the major issues in this giant clusterfuck we're heading on towards) - but you really have to have your head buried in the sand *not* to see a certain pattern. 

What pattern?

&gt;But hey, as an example: I have been speaking about Tories introducing ISP-based opt-out content filters on all kinds of stuff when they started forcing the ISPs to block *just* The Pirate Bay the first time in late 2011. So‚Ä¶ Maybe it's just me who sees that it's clearly a lot of ""Break them off some bread, they want the whole damn basket"" going on in here, and maybe it's just me who can connect the dots and make sense out of all those small hints coming from left, right and centre. Certainly, quite often feels like I'm one of the very few who sees it's all grooming people and tightening the noose one inch at a time.

Lol what?

&gt;I applaud your optimism/naivety* (* - delete inappropriate), but, really, a bit of knowledge of the world around me, a bit of real-world experience, along with an ounce of common sense, all tell me you're in for a nasty surprise. 

I don't think I'm in for any surprise at all. Understanding the other side doesn't mean I agree with them. I think ultimately it will be better for the economy if we stay in, that doesn't mean reasoning for leaving  doesn't exist. In addition what does better even mean? More economic growth? More economic growth doesn't neccerarily translate into a better qol for the people. 

We hear a lot that the economy is doing great, because it is, but the latest wealth isn't getting to those depressed areas that unsurprisingly voted for brexit.

This is an interesting topic, but would you be willing to edit the post a little so it conforms to our [submission rules?](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules)

Specifically, this probably needs a bit more background as far as what such systems have been proposed.  Also you messed up formatting you link by putting a period in the middle.

Also, your questions at the end aren't really neutrally framed and are you sort of answering your own question, which isn't allowed.

Thanks for participating.

&gt;""The school failed in providing a safe space for conservative students to go see a speaker. You agree with that point, yes?""

I agree it wasn't safe. Beyond that? Since the University is in no way a law enforcement organization, they are not charged with physically engaging violent rioters.

They did what any ""civilian"" organization could do. They notified relevant parties, engaged law enforcement, arranged for appropriate spaces for both the speaker and the protesters, who have equal right to speak at ANY public event.

What you seem to be trying to do is imply that if school officials didn't engage physical altercations (that they are not in any way legally allowed to do, by the way. Seeking out violence to engage in is not covered by almost any state's self defense laws) then they are responsible for violent assholes who were bussed in.

You seem to have a *need* to blame University officials, despite the fact that there are legal and ethical limits to what they could do to prevent this, and they made all realistic effort to meet those limits.

The police, who *ARE* charged with the physical enforcement of these laws, chose not to engage. The blame rests squarely there.

I've seen enough armed conflict to tell you I'm not gonna ""armchair General"" someone else's engagement. If your experience allows you that luxury, more power to you."

"The rules for seller's disclosures are very state specific. Until you provide a state and get a state-specific response, you should take any answers you receive with a grain of salt.

With that said, I will tell you how this would work in SC.

Each item on the disclosure has Yes, No, or No representation. The seller in this case would need to mark every one with No Representation.

When you sign a contract to buy, there is a section that says you either have signed a disclosure or agree to proceed without one. If you signed the one saying that you received a disclosure then you would probably need to go ahead and complete this process, otherwise you said you did something that you didn't do, which is a fault on you as well. But again, not until the seller goes through and marks the No Representation on each item."

Clonal reversal of ageing-associated stem cell lineage bias via a pluripotent intermediate
Martin Wahlestedt, Eva Erlandsson[‚Ä¶]David Bryder

Nature Communications 8, Article number: 14533 (2017)

Abstract:

&gt; Ageing associates with significant alterations in somatic/adult stem cells and therapies to counteract these might have profound benefits for health. In the blood, haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) ageing is linked to several functional shortcomings. However, besides the recent realization that individual HSCs might be preset differentially already from young age, HSCs might also age asynchronously. Evaluating the prospects for HSC rejuvenation therefore ultimately requires approaching those HSCs that are functionally affected by age. Here we combine genetic barcoding of aged murine HSCs with the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. This allows us to specifically focus on aged HSCs presenting with a pronounced lineage skewing, a hallmark of HSC ageing. Functional and molecular evaluations reveal haematopoiesis from these iPS clones to be indistinguishable from that associating with young mice. Our data thereby provide direct support to the notion that several key functional attributes of HSC ageing can be reversed."

With that said, I do still maintain (as I have before) that there's far more negotiating room than Theresa May is currently implying.

"First of all, Bloomberg's conflation of illegals with legitimate immigration is very disingenuous.  Nothing is going to happen to individuals that took the effort to become citizens.  It won't prevent innovation from happening, but it may affect industries that rely on that market distortion - as shown in the article.  

Given that those jobs were normally done by citizens, it looks like the complete opposite.  The market would adjust and accept more citizens (naturalized and born) shut out by the rampant use of illegals.  

In no case does distortion increase, it remains the same.

"So the problem seems to be that these jobs are particularly shitty, but also have shitty wages, so noone in the UK who is used to doing comparatively less shitty work wants to take the jobs.    
     
The first option of course is in increase the wages. Other industries don't seem to have a problem paying more money for shitty jobs (e.g. binman. Anyone can do that job, but it consistently attracts above minimum wage).    
    
However I accept the food industry is slightly different due to it's upward pressure on the rest of the market. A large increase in costs would through market forces lead to a reduction in consumption due to lower affordability. I'm sure there's some mid point to be found but the point is there.    
    
So if the employers aren't willing to accept the increased costs of not paying shitty wages, and the market isn't able to accept the increased costs either (though I believe it can), it seems a ripe market for further automation. Which with the low unemployment wouldn't be such an issue."

"The margin of victory was about 4%.

Yes, ""if"" 1.89% had changed their minds it would have been 50/50.

But what you seem unable to accept is that **they didn't change their minds** - therefore Leave exceeded Remain by 1 million votes and 4%.

No amount of saying ""I'm going to **pretend** that Leave only won by 500,000 votes and I'm going to bin the other 500,000 votes because *they could* have changed their minds"".

Only they didn't change their minds. People cast 1 million more votes for Leave than Remain, and no amount of pretending on your part changes that fact!!! When they tally the votes it *is* like a football match - you see, they just count, vote by vote.  

It is kinda sad that Remainers are trying to delegitimise the votes by pretending that Remain wasn't behind Leave by 1 million votes. But then they are europhiles, they long for a world where referendums are overturned, the euro tradition of dictators/nazis/communists/absolute monarchs and ""strong govt means ignoring votes"" was the norm! 

Why don't you go emigrate to the EU if you feel that way - they do a nice line in fascism in Hungary, and it is EU-approved too, you'll love it!"

Thanks so much for this comment. It's so important for people to realize that democracy is such a recent thing in this country.

"If the state wants to repossess my car, they need to launch proceedings on that, and I have a right to due process/etc.  Meanwhile, many of the restraints on my person operate entirely absent such processes.

Driving drunk goes to a risk to other people, which I'd view as a legitimate aim of government there.  But I can't see that government has such an interest in preventing me from harming myself, assuming this is done in a fashion that doesn't endanger others.  "

&gt; One should be careful about generalizing from one's limited personal experience. 

1. Where is the generality in ""my local and state parties""? And by the way, you have no idea what my experience is; much less whether it is limited.
2. My ""generalization"" re my local and state parties was in response to yours. About Democrats nationwide, ironically enough.


&gt; And you appear to be ignoring the tens of millions of grassroots Democrats

Yes, but only because they are beside the point. You can't run for office unless you get past the local and state parties. Many of which showed themselves to be in the thrall of the corrupt national party. That money-laundering arrangement between the Clinton campaign and the state parties springs to mind.

"Also to answer your original question more fully, I don't have issues with using the niacinamide with tret in my curology Rx or with AHA about once a week, but I do wait times after the actives and have the Hada Labo as a layer between them and the niacinamide. Curology uses tret and niacinamide in the same formula, so you shouldn't have an issue with those two, and acids CAN be an issue but my understanding is that the reaction people are warned of isn't that common and can be staved off by wait times. I don't use the Benton essence but I do use the steam cream at the end of my routine and don't have issues with the two products interacting. If it helps, this is my PM routine (where I use the Ordinary Niacinamide):  
Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil

"They are empty because the apartments are tiny and poorly constructed, not because they don't have enough parking.

I live in a complex of about 400 apartments, and this was built at a time when there was a requirement to have at least one parking space per apartment - and many have two or even more. The reality is that there are a huge number of parking spots that are never occupied. For security reasons, we can only rent spots out to other residents and not to the public. The prices as seen on the noticeboard are very low.

On the other hand, there is much higher demand for storage cages in the carpark.

I understand having one parking spot per apartment for suburban developments, but in densely populated areas with good public transport you will find that enough people just don't bother with a car."

I have friends who feel unsafe at Pride.  Police will not feel unsafe for being asked not to have a float and or wear a uniform.  

The message that the mental health of people who have been harmed by police misconduct is prioritized over the egos of the police is an important one to send, in my eyes.  This priority would be shared by any police officer who is a good person, so it should not cause much conflict.

Anything can happen with this stock bc there's so many traders just trying to hop on instead of longterm investors who have strong conviction about the future of the company. When it falls it falls quickly and it doesn't take that substantial of news to scare people into selling (as seen today by the selling after the bs downgrade). I'm just cautioning against watching 100 as the support line bc it fell below for a while last time this happened before it popped back up above 100.

Shareblue will be the dynamic nucleus of a multi-platform media company that informs engages, and arms Americans to fight.  Here's what success will look like:

&gt;Shareblue will become the de facto news outlet for opposition leaders and the grassroots.

&gt;Trump allies will be forced to step down and change course due to news pushed by Shareblue.

Not really. The worst case validation time for a pathological segwit transaction is better than the worst case validation time for a pathological non-segwit transaction. However since the blockchain currently contains none of those transactions there is no real realized performance improvement.

Compared to what? A simple block size limit increase of n% will increase transaction throughput by exactly n%. The corresponding segwit improvement is only marginal at best because of substantial added overhead in terms of network bandwidth.

"Why does there need to be a new program? You have to look at what is in place already. There is already a program for the care of roadways. It falls under the Transportation portion of the state budget. The problem is the money raised by the taxes that fund that section of the budget are being misused within the budget. The money made is going to other programs and to the general fund. Fix the budget we have by cutting out wasteful programs. You mention the gas tax has not been adjusted for inflation, and I understand things cost more now. But that doesn't explain why there is less money year after year. The state has been cutting funding to the county road budgets each year for the last decade. Why? Where is the money going? Don't try to come up with some crazy explanation like people buy less gas because it doesn't account for a lose of tens of millions of dollars from the budget. This current legislation has language to prevent the transfer of the funds to budgetary items outside of transportation,  why do they have to include that? Because the money currently being raised is finding its way out of the transportation budget it is supposed to fund. It's a ploy to take more money from the tax payer. "

Flexible Transactions (The BU alternative fix to malleability)



&gt; Is that data available only to segwit transactions, or is the capacity increase available to ALL transactions?

Transactions that don't redeem the input by segregating the witness also get a capacity increase, as space is freed up by those that do segregate the witness.  Therefore all transactions get an effective capacity increase, even from non upgraded clients.  Although those upgrading to SegWit get a larger capacity increase.

**This is in contrast to a hardfork that requires ALL clients to upgrade anyway.**   Therefore SegWit's 2MB of capacity is **strictly faster** than an equivalent hardfork to 2MB of capacity.

SegWit is also **strictly more respectful to older transaction formats** than BU' s method of totally banning all old transaction types with FT

Do you see why there can't be further  compromise now?  SegWit is strictly better than what BU are proposing, in terms of achieving faster capacity increases

"While I agree with you on principle, I have amended my beliefs since I got 2 little rugrats. When they were 6,7,8,9, my partner would sometimes jokingly call me 'gay'. Or say that something I was doing was 'gay'. The kids would ask, ""What does that mean?"" Happy, of course, because homosexuality just isn't a concept my 6 year old even needs to contemplate. Think of the uncomfortable conversations parents would have to have with kids who saw an obviously transgendered person using their restroom. 

It just seems like a bridge too far, in that instance (to me). There is no need to be confronted with that at a young age. Maybe I was being naive thinking I could shelter them, but they are learning about those things now in Middle School... from their friends.

"Yes the typical counter-argument to the ""how could something come from nothing, God must have created it"" is ""the same logic can be applied to God then: What created God?"" to which the response is usually something along the lines of ""God is eternal"" to which you can argue ""We could just as easily say that the Universe is eternal""...


You might find this interesting though: I was pondering on this notion  that existence and things that exist must have a cause and I wanted to understand how something could have come from nothing in the first place. So with a bit of creativity I came up with a word to explain it, which I admit is a made up word, but it actually could make a lot of sense:

""autocausality"" or ""autocausal""

Basically if something is ""autocausal"" then it causes itself.

Food for thought I guess :)"

Turkey is guilty of aiding and profiting from Jihad. Erdogan has literally threatened the EU with an unending wave of migrants if the EU didn't agree to 'financial assistance'. Turkey is perhaps the most blatant belligerent terror state-sponsor to act in this conflict, not far from Iran.

"&gt;  Your policy increases harm to children of parents Y.

It's not preventing youth from coming out to the parents themselves. LGBTQ youth can still come out to loving and caring parents Y for parental support. They still have that agency and control; it's not taken away simply because teachers can't out them.  
  
If we didn't have teachers and schools that were so blatantly anti-GSA, anti-LGBTQ, I might agree with you that allowing some room for teachers to inform parents *if a situation in which outing the child would prevent harm* could be permitted. Sadly, we do have anti-LGBTQ schools/teachers and I can't support a policy that gives those schools/teachers the control over outing a student.

"&gt; The price of Bitcoin rose significantly during long periods of high fees, broke ATHs and went above the price of an oz of gold. Even after the ETF was declined the price was still in this high price range.

Fair point.

I believe the growth at the end of previous year was due to ""good news"" from particularly India, but also Australia and Venezuela that Bitcoin could become the winner of the ""war on cash"" in those countries, plus increased demand from those countries.  However,  with the current capacity limit Bitcoin is not at all suitable for serving any significant portion of the cash-users in those countries, so I deemed the growth to be artificial.

After the ETF-news was released, there is speculation that the continued growth was due to demand from new holders hearing about this ETF thing - sometimes even bad news can be good PR as it reaches people who otherwise wouldn't hear about the brand.

&gt; It seems to me it's the FUD about a contentious/controversial hard fork and split chain which is causing the price to fall. That is only my opinion, not fact.

Seems about correct.

It seems quite clear to me that the price was still growing after AntPool announcing its support for BU - the price started falling once the statement from the exchanges were released - quite much FUD in that one, and also asserting that the ""protocol upgrade"" would indeed be an altcoin."

"Bitcoin as it currently exists cannot support more than roughly the number of users it currently has. Maybe you believe that number to be a million, let's say 10 million to be generous. But this is basically it, and a cryptocurrency that can't support more than 10 million people *will definitely* be replaced by one that can.

Bitcoin with SegWit gets to maybe double that user number, so 20 million. Again, that's not a big enough network to last. It will absolutely be replaced.

Bitcoin with SegWit and Lightning network could be maybe 10 times bigger again (depends whose doing the maths and what assumptions they make about people tying up funds for long periods of time), so 200 million. And that's the worst possible point. 

200 million sounds huge but in the modern, globalised, social-networking world it's still not enough. The other 7 billion people will want to use crytocurrency as well, and that won't be possible without finally forking the blocksize. But at that point, with maybe 200 million users, with maybe *trillions* of dollars of value on the line, it will be completely impossible to change any protocol level rule. Even one like ""no more than 1MB of data every 10 minutes"".

"it was a close vote. it would be a large underestimation to say that 2% of people considered saving the NHS, which was widely publicised, as an issue they took into account before voting on.

if that is correct then the vote was decisively swayed based on a flat out lie, and in my view is completely invalidated by their dishonest campaigning.

its completely incorrect to say that the public should have known this was the case and seen through the lies. we have many studies that show a significant proportion of the population do not use critical thinking skills in this kind of situation and can be easily swayed by the information targeted at them. they do still have a right to vote.

Regarding taxes, they might be in favour of higher income taxes if it means lower consumption taxes, as was the case before Thatcher. Taxes for most people went up, but revenue has not.

&gt; Not long ago, Steve Bannon‚Äôs Capitol Hill townhouse had a plaque next to the front door proclaiming it ‚ÄúThe Breitbart Embassy.‚Äù A similar sign may as well be placed at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, renaming the White House ‚ÄúThe Breitbart House,‚Äù one dedicated to bringing down the old power structure, including the Republican and Democratic establishments, and destroying the power of the international so-called Davos elites.
&gt; 
&gt; The Breitbart House is apocalyptic. It aims to bring down the powers that be, and to replace them with a new world order. That‚Äôs a big task.

&gt; 
&gt; In audio recordings of his Sirius/XM radio program from 2015 and 2016, USA Today reported, Bannon ‚Äútold his listeners that the United States and the Western world are engaged in a ‚Äòglobal existential war,‚Äô and he entertained claims that a ‚Äòfifth column‚Äô of Islamist sympathizers had infiltrated the U.S. government and news media.‚Äù Among other predictions, he said America and China would go to war in five to 10 years in the South China Sea.

"hey there, sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

progressive as a word and a concept, is of course not regressive, but using the word as a political affliation, and not in the sense of the progressive party, which meant you supported their platform and paid dues/registered with them, but as a type of democrat or person on the ""left,"" is no more meaningful than calling yourself a blue or a liberal or ""on the left.""

used that way, progressive is an amorphous term that can mean anything or nothing. it was chosen, focus grouped actually, because it made people feel good about themselves, and morally and intellectually superior over those who they did not consider progressive. the word was pushed to replace liberal, which had been allowed to become a slur. what is the difference between a liberal and a progressive? a dem and a progressive?  a socialist and a progressive? what economic policy does a progressive support? do progressives support a manned mission to mars? to be progressive, do you have to think bernie is great? 


when official trigger words are created they are always left ill defined. progressive was entroduced as a trigger word. what it triggers is divissiveness. additionally, the danger one faces when using empty words to define themselves and their beliefs is that they often fail to define themselves and their beliefs, leaving the prey to manipulation.

i'm not suggesting people use leftist, it was just an example of a name that still has specific meaning, because the dems wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole. i doubt most who would lable themself a progressive would actually be a leftist. like you, most would likely feel it has too much baggage. and if one feels that way, they are not leftists (which is fine!).

but for those of us that are leftists, we wear that baggage as a badge of honor. leftist never got diluted, it never got prettied up. it still means what it meant in the estates general during the french revolution, where it was coined (during the french revolution in the ""congressional"" meetings trying to hammer out what the new govt would be, the jacobins, the anti-monarchial, pro-economic-egalitarian republicans, sat on the left side of the hall, the monarchists sat on the right)(republican properly means one who supports a democratic republic)(fwiw, liberal properly means one who supports classical liberal economics, i.e. laisze faire...neoliberalism comes from that).

i am an anarchist. this has a very specific meaning and ideology: i oppose all forms of heierarchy because heirarchy is the root of all oppression, i oppose all forms of property because property is the root of all heirarchy. i am anti-statist and believe that everyone has the inalienable right to opt out. i believe the only way to move forward is to jettison our representatives, just as we jettisoned our kings and our priests. i believe that the only road ahead that will not lead right back to where we are now, is to adopt universal direct democracy, and be done with it.

like a lot of voters in referendum states, i vote regularly because of the props,  not the candidates. consider this: 15 years ago over 60% of FL voted to give sows and piglets the constitutional right to have enough room to lie down and turn around in their pens. that year FL went to bush. if that had been proposed as a ""democrat initiative"" or ""progressive initiative"" or a ""republican initiative"" it would have failed. all because of some stupid, meaningless name.

i'm not saying don't call yourself a progressive if you wish, but that if you do so, do it knowing you are using a name handpicked to manipulate you."

"Obama promised something that wasn't in his power to deliver?  Yeah, I already knew that.  My point was that I'm used to broken campaign promises, even things that I really wanted to happen.  Politics is often the art of withholding something that the other side wants until you get what you want.  Obviously, that part of the negotiation was within Obama's power, and yet he didn't do that.

So, I still hold him accountable for making a promise that he didn't follow through on, because while he could not do it by ""waving his hand"" he could have done it through the art of compromise and negotiation.  At the end of the day, it just wasn't important enough to him.

I figure that Trump doesn't want to release his tax records because it shows something that he doesn't want the public to see.  Perhaps that he's lost a shitload of money over the last 20 years, or that he's used questionable tax-loopholes that most people don't have access to. Whatever the reason, it would hurt the image that he wants people to believe.  It's the same reason that the Clintons were so protective of many aspects of their lives - they had secrets that they wanted to keep.  For them, it wasn't ""tax returns"" so they were free with them.  For Trump, it is.  

For me, his tax returns are the least of his problems.  I think he's a very poor choice for public office, because he's ego-centric, cares more about his personal image than about the people he's supposed to be serving, and seems to think that he is smarter and more knowledgeable than any of the experts in the fields of concern when running the government. I know someone like that - always thinking he knows better than the experts on every subject.  I would never want that person to run the nation. It would be a disaster.

So, I think the push for his tax records is a red herring.  We can fight about that, or we could fight about something that actually matters.  You pick your battles."

"&gt;&gt; If God can do miracles which violate the laws &amp; theories of physics, then said laws &amp; theories are wrong.

&gt; If a programmer can violate the laws she programmed into her VR world in localized ways to perform 'miracles', does that mean that those laws are wrong? That they don't exist? No.

This is a misunderstanding on your part. A [scientific law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law) is supposed to be *a statement based on repeated experimental observations that describes some aspects of the universe. A scientific law* **always applies** *under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements.*

Note that a theory is like a law except that a theory includes an explanatory element whereas a law does not, or in other words a scientific theory is an explanation whereas as scientific law is merely a description.

So, do you see the highlighted part about *always applies*? Laws and theories are supposed to always apply. So if *God can do miracles which violate the laws &amp; theories of physics, then said laws &amp; theories* would not in fact always apply, would they? Hence they would be wrong.

&gt;&gt; If you want to insist that an all-powerful God exists, then you must abandon all of our science laws &amp; theories.

&gt; Reiterating your claim doesn't prove it.

Repeatedly claiming it is wrong when it isn't doesn't make it wrong.

&gt;You are arguing for a definition of God that is omnipotent but exists within our universe and is subject to its laws. I have never heard any monotheist claim that definition. So, you're attacking a straw man.

I have done no such thing. I have repeatedly pointed out that *if God can do miracles which violate the laws &amp; theories of physics* (of this universe), *then said laws &amp; theories are wrong* (within this universe).

&gt;God is necessarily outside of our universe.

Yet the claims of religions include the claim that said God can perform miracles within this universe that violate the laws of physics of this universe. I merely point out that if such claims are true the said laws of physics are wrong (because they do not always apply and they are supposed to).

&gt;The modern cosmology you keep linking me to says that it is entirely possible, even somewhat probable, that our universe is not the only one that exists. I don't know where you want to go from here.

This does not impact the argument  being made one iota.

I repeat, since you seem to be a bit slow on comprehension, that *if you want to insist that an all-powerful God exists* (and acts in this universe), *then you must abandon all of our science laws &amp; theories*."

"Well your skin needs moisture (oil) and hydration (water).  Humectants, emollients, occlusives are just things that help your skin with those needs.

The hadalabo milk isn't very moisturizing. You might need something that's just a bit heavier.

I determine what my skin needs by looking at the condition it's in, my skintype, the climate I'm in etc. My skin is dry (lacking oil) and dehydrated (lacking water) so for me, it's all about finding a good balance of hydration and oil.  People with dehydrated skin generally love lots of thin watery layers (lots of hydrating toners). Dry skinned people need heavier products containing more emollients (oily type products) that smooth and soften the skin. I use a pretty nourishing moisturizer, a face oil, sleeping pack.  Occlusives are good to prevent water from evaporating off the surface of your skin. They're great at night because after you've applied all of your products, it keeps everything from evaporating away."

"Well, you don't know what the checksum is until you try and calculate it. So you don't know what sort of ""junk"" will fit in, and the odds of finding a collision randomly are pretty much non-existent. So you need to try tons of random junk until you find something that works. That's why it took Google so much time and money, even though they exploited the way SHA1 works and got the results 100.000x faster than just brute forcing every single option.

The thing is, once you have one collision, it works only for the data you tried it with. For other data you need another junk to add. Which would be another years of waiting for the thing to calculate by trying random stuff. Say, ""abc"" + ""some junk"" gives a checksum of 123, now ""abcd"" needs something different than ""some junk"" to get the same checksum, so you basically try millions of random pieces of junk until something fits in."

"&gt; It's unlikely you will setup a channel directly with a third party, but rather with a hub, which has existing channels open with other third parties. It's unclear how the routing algorithm will prevent a large central hub forming which has the lowest fees (economies of scale), availability of funds to create channels and existing connections with many nodes.

It will be similar to mobile service providers: there are various hubs you can join, each offering various benefits and prices. Over time, these hubs will start collaborating, you can send transactions to people on other hubs as well.

Making transactions to someone on the same hub will be relatively cheap and easy. Inter-hub transactions will be somewhat more costly.

Since these hubs will probably offer bitcoin wallet services as well, new users will probably open a wallet with one and be done with it, no fiddling with LN channels and wallets, just a simple web ui.

&gt;Instead Core/Blockstream chose to use shady backroom deals with miners, FUD/BS, censorship, and threats to cripple Bitcoin(intentionally or not). r/Bitcoin has taken every opportunity to bash down anybody who mentioned Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, big blocks, or any other suggestion that didn't fit the Core/Blockstream vision of Bitcoin. 

&gt;While Core had the hashrate and miners on their side, r/Bitcoin(and Core devs) were cocky and arrogant, and were constantly deriding r/btc, Andresen, Zander, and the Unlimited team.

&gt;Now the tables are turning... and there is talk from r/Bitcoin of compromise. Why wasn't compromise part of r/Bitcoin's discourse 2 years ago before the blocks were not full and it didn't cost $1.00(or more) to get a Tx included in a block? Small blockers have shot themselves in the foot.

&gt;Why should big block supporters(devs, users, businesses, miners) back a compromise now when they were chastised and derided for 2 years? We are now very close to having this debate finished once and for all, so let's just keep pushing for real scaling solutions starting with larger blocks.

"Great. 


I suggest not using your credit cards until you pay them off, and treat the ""available credit"" as an emergency fund for if you lose your job or something. With 1k available credit you could probably keep as low as 1k in the bank so long as that doesn't cause account fees and you have a debit card you can use. 1.5k may be safer.

"&gt;May gets whatever deal she likes, no oversight from the people or from Parliament?

The people do not need to be consulted on the minutiae of the negotiations, and there will be oversight from Parliament throughout.

A ""deal or no deal"" vote is the best option we have in terms of our negotiating position and the simple practicalities that mean the PM is never going to have the chance to go back and re-negotiate. 

The Lib Dem proposal involves two Leave options and one Remain option. It is *designed not to give people a say, but to ensure a second referendum results in a Remain win*. They consistently deny this despite it being utterly, utterly blatant. Hence my comment about their opportunism. 

Unfortunately this kind of behaviour is commonplace with the Lib Dems."
"I disagree that funding has been cut, as a percentage of GDP and in absolute terms spending has gone up pretty much every year since the NHS was created. Just look at the numbers employed. 1.7 mil. There is huge wastage and inefficiency in the organisation. I also think it is morally wrong that we have to pay for the healthcare of people who make decisions we fundamentally disagree with. Comparing with cars polluting is a false equivalency. Taxes on high polluting vehicles already exist and I would support them going up as Sadiq has just done in London. Spending on social care is the responsibility of local councils, they are well within there rights to maintain spending or increase the council tax if they have to.

You're saying the rights of people during YYYY who also arrived in YYYY should be the same as those who arrived in XXXX. Similarly, those who arrived in XXXX should retain the same rights as were afforded in XXXX during YYYY. So nothing should change for anyone until ZZZZ which is fair enough barring close to the transition point where there are some kludges (there are an array of potential issues there).

The actual issue is that those who will arrived in XXXX might not have the same rights during ZZZZ as those who arrived in YYYY.

I hope that clears it up. There are a bunch of issues and it seems people are all getting lost in it and confused about what is what."

"The First Nations Financial Transparency Act was rolled back. It called, among other things, for public disclosure of compensation for band leadership (for both public and business responsibilities) and public disclosure of details of band business operations.

First Nations leaders were unhappy with this as they don't feel they should be required to disclose financial information related to their businesses, as opposed to their public, finances.

Now, as then, as before the FNFTA, bands provide detailed reports on their use of public funds, and are audited regularly.

Senator Murray Sinclair, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, had this to say about audit:

&gt;The irresponsibility lies with the wealthy who have more than enough money that they don't even contribute back into the economy

Yes, the wealthy have a lot of money.  A lot of this money was illegitimately earned through government contracts, monopolistic rent-seeking behavior, etc.  That's not what is at argument here.  The individual mandate forced young people in the market at outrageous prices and lowered premiums for the elderly.  Surely, you can't support that kind of wealth redistribution.  "

"In brief, I think climate change is real, slight, possibly partially human caused, and more benign than alarming, especially when the beneficial effects of CO2 on plant life are taken into account. I also think everything that has been proposed to mitigate it (renewable energy, organics, opposition to economic growth, taxes - always taxes) is extremely harmful and counter productive to the environment and to human flourishing.

In terms of the science,  there is growing evidence of much smaller climate sensitivity to CO2 than is assumed to create alarm, and even if the most drastic emissions reductions proposed occurred, we would see little impact on the climate in the 21st century (even if you believe the climate models, which their abject  failure to date  gives us little reason to do)."

"&gt;It's the Senate's job to hold hearings for nominees. That responsibility doesn't change regardless of the status of the candidate.

Why? Because you say so? The Senate has no obligation to hold hearings. Like I said, the Senate make their own rules and procedures. They can hold hearings if they want, or they can immediately hold an up or down vote with no debate, or they can sit on it and do nothing until the president nominates someone suitable. They are all equally viable and equally constitutional.

"To clarify, I definitely agree with the Tastytrade mechanics, I just meant when discussing options in posts in the forum here, it seems like a lot of posts are just 'here is my entry/ exit position', which given an underlying, we could just pull up in the option chain what to trade.

"&gt; but if it were really that important, bitcoin wouldn't have survived until today.

Sorry but this is really crappy reasoning. Bitcoin has survived until today but it could be made even better.

&gt; This is especially true, since segwit fixes malleability only for new segwit transactions. So even with segwit companies have to deal with transaction malleability for many years to come.

The malleability fix is optional, it is even desirable in some cases. But companies who don't want their transactions to be open to malleability can just adopt segwit and completely stop it."

When someone dies from a car accident, it was after weighing the costs and benefits of driving, in which they have significant latittude to protect themselves from injury (more risk averse driving).  In contrast, terrorism is a ""tail risk"" event in which case there aren't robust statistics and ease of computing and managing risk.

It's easy to drive more safely.  It's not so easy to ""avoid anything a terrorist would ever target, given that they deliberately want to target things that convey the message that everyone is at risk""."

We usually get 1-2 calls from google business listing which suddenly stopped. For few days we didn't noticed but one day i google my business name and was shocked to see competitors information being displayed. I called them immediately they said they are sorry and blamed their seo company. I edited the listing myself and asked my friends to suggest google the same. I also contacted other affected companies and told them about this issue. Recently i received the call from google and they told me that they have fixed the issue.

Right after that their website was also disappeared from google search results. I guess they got their punishment."

"Many are suggesting that OP can get a lawyer to uncover the names of those responsible. I don't think it is quite that simple:

I doubt OP is entitled to that kind of information. (This wasn't for copyright)

As whoever got their account taken down used an informal non-legal method (mainly the on-site report feature). The difference between this and copyright stuff is with copyright the reporting party is filing a formal legal document/challenge (DCMA takedown or similar) and avowing their rightful ownership of the content. With the other methods its just some person reporting them to google for violating google's rules and google deciding it agrees with them (or in theory even google itself noticing something and taking action).

Quite honestly it looks like one of about three things is happening here:

1. Google isn't actually reviewing the appeals and is lying about that.

2. Google is reviewing the appeals but has some animus or bias against the OP and their videos/ideas and is sticking with it while using an inappropriate boilerplate excuse.

3. OP actually violated the rules, Google caught them and is unwilling to divulge further details as they don't want to tip off spammers/scammers as to how their systems work (potentially risking those people figuring out how to work around them). 

I'm curious OP if you've ever used any kind of services that promise to increase your viewership rate or monetize your content (outside of youtube's official program)?

All this said, filing some sort of legal challenge might get their attention. Not that you could necessarily win in court against them, but it might prompt them to actually carefully review what happened to avoid having to deal with it."

This is just a boilerplate Section 1A risk factor disclosure like the ones that are included in every SEC filing.  Because they are not currently profitable, they pretty much have to state this.  Their lawyers were going to make them.  

From Twitter's S-1:

""If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and to manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.""

Due to the uproar caused by this, many people apparently are not familiar with the basic sections of registration statements or 10-Ks which is unfortunate and slightly alarming, but I guess if they're going to include such predictable warnings, I can't blame them.

"&gt; I watched a documentary on Vice and they interview a Cartel member while he was making Meth and he used the exact same justification for why he was doing it. This is a self defeating way of thinking, it is preventing the Mexican people from taking control of their own future. 

I remember such an attitude when I lived in the Philippines. It's way deeper than any sort of verbal excuse can clearly spell out. 

Basically, much of the wealth is locked up at the top where those folks live their own separate lives(even worse, many invest overseas or keep their money abroad so it's reverse trickle down economics...alternatively they invest locally in short term investments or rent seeking arrangements(sharecropping). Middle class is waaay smaller and opportunities to move up via work are limited since the few white collar jobs have tons of competition(so low pay). 

In the USA, if you just want to make decent money, you can always just go study accounting or programming....in poor countries, any remotely ""make money easily out of school"" is overly saturated and the domestic market for such work is limited too.

Starting a business is cheaper but generally competition is fierce, overly saturated for stuff like food, and the wealthy top can outspend you or hire thugs to shut you down.....loans are harder to come by.

In such a society, the easiest way to get money is from abroad(legally, illegally) or to leech(corruption, scams, theft) off any big money deals going through the country. Since everybody has a ""get mine, dog eat dog"" attitude in life, trust levels when it comes to money is extremely low......selling meth to the USA is bad.....but there aren't any comparable options legally unless your a genius or from a wealthy family: the concept of a super honest but very wealthy businessman/politician is a unicorn unlike it is in the west.

"&gt; Everything that helps life is good, everything that destroys life is evil.

That is a statement that you subjectively believe to be true.  Any truth derived from it is true only relative to that statement.

There are other ways of viewing morality than just this, and the statement is probably at some level incompatible with utilitarianism.  One would conclude from your statement that more life is better, even if that life entails more suffering.  Utilitarianism seeks to reduce suffering.

But those both are inconsistent with authoritarianism and hedonism,  not to mention Confucianism (which treats duty as the standard of good) which are also perfectly valid as bases for a moral code.  A person is subjectively free to ground morality however they choose.

So no, IMO.  Objective (as in ""true in all circumstances"" or ""a condition of the cosmos"") morality does not and cannot exist."
"There is quite a difference between an SPV client and other light clients.

With most light clients, you rely on the central servers of that client.

With an SPV client (like multibit), you *do not* rely on a central authority, nor your peers. You verify yourself that your transaction is in the blockchain with enough proper PoW on top of it.

The only thing that you need to trust is that the mining majority is honest, (just like with a full node)."
"Good politicians create a narrative about themselves via the issues they support or oppose. You have to figure out how the issue that you are lobbying on ties back into the narrative the politician is trying to build, and then make that connection explicit.

Clearly explaining the issue isn't enough. There are plenty of worthy issues that are never addressed simply because there isn't enough time. How does your issue DIRECTLY impact the politician? 

Check out their campaign disclosures to see who their biggest donors are. Check out their media releases. Is there a common theme among them? Get letters of support from organizations that support the official. 

Do the politicians you're speaking with already have established, on-the-record positions on the issues you will be discussing? If so, point those out and say something like, ""The issue we are discussing today furthers this aspect of your agenda by...""

Politicians respond to votes. You can't just explain the issue. You also have to explain how your issue will impact their next race and the narrative they are building to run that race. "

"Haha, to be completely honest this was sort of a surprise for us. What I think is really neat is that by weighting your goals (e.g., + clicks, - unsubscribes, + engagement, etc.) differently you can control how the algorithm responds. So, for example, if it's super important that you don't annoy people and have a really low spam rate, you tell us that it's something you really need to avoid. If, instead, you don't really care as much about unsubscribes, you can make it more aggressive (hopefully you do care about spamming people, though...). Anyways, just goes to show that it's really customizable based on your goals. Thanks for having a read!"

Standing in the ""non-EU"" line at passport control however is a major pain in the arse, particularly when you land with a plane full of Chinese tourists (they always seem to take longer to process).

Saudi Arabia did that once and it created the first reasons for OBL to start attacking the US.

"The potential for the chain split exists. However, 'wait and do nothing' doesn't work in bitcoin-world. We have a chicken-and-egg problem where, metaphorically, people say ""Well nobody is going to vote for a non-frontrunner candidate, so I'm not voting at all because what I want can't happen!""

Then this BIP comes along and says ""Here is the candidate you all wanted to vote for, you just need to donate to their campaign!"" We donate by running full nodes with this client. As more people join the campaign, the unknown becomes a front-runner candidate, and it becomes possible for the masses to get what they want, because a few people were brave/smart/willing enough to resolve the chicken-and-egg problem before wider agreement existed on who would win and who could win.

Think about it this way: a chain split only occurs if people let themselves be locked to inaction by fear. If we are brave and dare to do something new, a chain split won't occur, because who mines blocks that can only be validated by a few dozen nodes scattered across the globe?"

Honest, yes I think they'd choose to attack the other party. This is what is already happening, if people want to know about the plan they look at the parties' website, the debates, the news. Running those short ads, where you can't even get in depth for any policy isn't as catching. 

People are against negative campaigns, yes. But the reason this kind of advertising is powerful is because it isn't conscious. If you hear some stupid clip and are being told the leader is incompetent, then you start to believe it. And of course, then there are others that actually believe the negative campaign slogans wholeheartedly. It creates a picture of the other parties that they play to their advantage. "
"Talk to Ken Ham for 3 minutes and ask yourself if he is rational or has a god between his ears?  The pope has a catholic god in his head, and all the imams have their own version of Allah in each of their heads. And as usual, all different.     

If a person believes in it, it doesn't matter if it really is real, I still have to deal with their delusion. All of the most baffling religious hogwash can be fully and completely explained under the theory that the sufferer has painted a god on the inside of their head. It is most often the same god their parents told them about, but not always. Sometimes they take it and run, like the imams of daesh when the fighters prayed for more whores, the god they describe changed from killing whores to inviting them to come join the party.  

When the very nature and desires of your god change depending on how horny you are, maybe your god isn't detached up in the sky but is a product of your own self interested brain.   

All 7 billion skulls on earth are candidates for god occupation. Currently somewhere above 75% actually believe their personally obsessed god is really up in the sky and is the only true god in the entire universe. This despite the existence of billions of other people describing their billions of unique gods to each other at every fucking opportunity.

"Ah, the immigration officials in Cambodia scammed me in three different ways!

When I go back to the counter he pretends I don't exist and keeps serving other people.

I move ahead to the second counter, the guy says the visa is $35. I give him $40 and he gives me my passport... and immediately starts serving the next person. I ask for my change, and he replies that I gave him the exact amount of $35, even though he still has my 2 x $20 bills in his hand.

"Honestly I don't think this is the case. Everyone knows obesity is unhealthy and is strongly related with heart disease, the leading cause of death for Americans.

Social campaigns telling women they don't need to be supermodels to be pretty are not the same as saying obesity is beautiful. 

According to the increasingly clear evidence, it's not necessarily overeatting that is making people so fat and unhealthy, but the actual quality of the food the eat, specifically the insane amount of sugar in everything.

I believe the FDA released a guide saying that the average woman could not even drink a single can of coca-cola without going over the daily recommended value. And that's ignoring the sugar in basically every other food product and drink.

Coca cola will still say it's healthy ""in moderation"" but their container sizes and sugar levels basically preclude the ability of a person to drink it in moderation, without throwing away the can half drank.

I'm getting off topic now but I just don't think safe-space progressiveism has anything to do with obesity in America. Americans have been fat and unhealthy before safe-spaces were a thing."

"It was noble, but then it slowly curupted those involved, they no longer wanted a new currency that was out of the control of the greedy bankers, they started to see $ signs, flash cars and all the things $ could buy, they started to act like the bankers themselves, sitting on their ass watching computer screens and charts of how much $ they could sell for. As this was happening new investers came along, high risk high gain traders, the kinda people who previously wrapped up debts and sold them on causing worldwide financial crisis. They loved this new bitcoin thing, they could easily manipulate the markets, they didn't have to worry much about regulation, it could all be done on a computer. Easy $$$

Most development kinda stalled, people were incouraged to hodl, they were told "" bitcoins not for coffee"" don't spend it or use it, just look at it and watch how its value increases, no-one cared as the fees went up and transactions started to fail, all the small people just hodl'd anyway and the big money was on exchanges, the rich just bought their transactions.

The path was set and the eventual disaster came, first the old wallet holders started to cash out while the price was good, this was offset by eager people wanting in on this investment of a lifetime, then the first of the big traders started to take his $profits the price started to fall, the fall started to trigger other traders to sell and the price fall even more, the ordinary people didn't have their bitcoin on exchanges and so even those that wanted to sell were behind all the traders (some started to realise that being a hodler was actually another name for bag holder and they felt letdown, most though just kept up the mantra if HODL and swore never to sell).

"you're pretty young so i'll just say that people like to make lgbt seem a little more common than it really is. in reality, you're gonna be pretty hard pressed to find people who are willing to go on dates and do normal, flirty, romantic things with members of the same sex. not impossible but it's not common

a big part is that we want to engage with others of the same sex and to experiment, and obviously most would like to experiment in a safe and fun way. unfortunately, of those few lgbt people you'll meet, many will have hangups and special rules as to how they'll express themselves depending on how ""out"" they are. it can be fairly frustrating. the lgbt community isn't necessarily any better than any other in terms of dating. many will simply try to manipulate others

and yea, there's dating sites, but do you really want everyone to see how you look and know your orientation? also, people become insanely picky about appearance on dating sites, way more than in real life

so, don't feel too bad about not dating yet. you're not doing anything wrong, it's just that it's more challenging than people make it seem"

So looks like long-term capital gains tax if you've had the stock for awhile.
Dividends are payments you receive from certain investments, such as corporate stocks and shares in a mutual fund. The term ""ordinary dividends‚Äù includes both qualified and nonqualified dividends, which are taxed at different rates.
Qualified dividends, such as most of those paid on corporate stocks, are taxed at long term capital gains rates ‚Äî which are lower than ordinary income tax rates. Nonqualified dividends, however, are taxed at the higher ordinary income tax rates.
In order to treat your dividends as qualified dividends, the IRS requires that you hold your stock investment for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days prior to the ex-dividend date ‚Äî which is the day after a corporation's board declares a dividend payment to shareholders.

"About every health system that implements a new EMR while also cutting the number of doctor's office visits in order to help them adjust to the increased time to learn how to navigate and document in that EMR, is going to lose money. It's simple, you are cutting your revenue stream, you are going to lose money.  
  
Why do hospitals do this? EMRs are massively complex - think of a digital representation of the human body crossed with the digital representation of a hospital, granted a fraction of that but it's a good metaphor. Say your general office visit is scheduled for 30 minutes. As a precaution some vendors actually advocate cutting the number of visits scheduled by half and increasing the time per patient to say 45 minutes or an hour to help the provider adjust. The problem when you do this is that providers get used to the new schedule and begin to like it, per human nature. When you bounce the schedule back, engagement drops and turnover rises. Regardless, it's a slow bounce back and the revenue hit is prolonged.   
  
Health systems thus have many strategic options to deal with this. If you have strong enough mission, engagement and branding, you can force your providers to NOT cut office visit schedules while learning the new EMR. This will dip your engagement and patient satisfaction scores and increase doctor burnout and the feeling that patients are getting stiffed because the providers are glued to the screen and multitasking 90% of the time, but sometimes this is almost essential for survival of the system, or even a goal of implementation without a massive force reduction afterwards (except contractors).  
  
This ofc visit issue is really only a part of the problem. There can be a myriad of issues with a rollout. For example, your order sets could be wrong in this one little area for your real world workflow. Yes, you do months or years of testing, but test environments are not the real world, and even having the actual staff test they are not in that real world mindset. Things will be missed. And then your order set doesn't work as planned and you missed having orders generated for a twenty thousand dollar procedure multiplied by a hundred until it's found a month after go-live. Woops. Multiply this across the enterprise.  
  
Also, with a new EMR you can train all you want but sometimes people are going to take shortcuts. Thousands of people in your system will use the EMR, from scheduling and registration folks, to financial clearance, to providers to coders. These people all have the power to impact hospital revenue positively or negatively. You try to make sure people are adequately trained, but in the end, you are trying to train dozens if not hundreds of different user ROLES each seeing different screens and with different workflows across ten to a hundred thousand users in your enterprise. Think about that. Each of those ten thousand people or a hundred thousand people given about two days to a week's worth of training in a massively complex system often weeks or months before roll out (because you have so many people to train) have the power to make a boo boo that impacts revenue. This can be anything from accidentally re-using an accounts receivable record or choosing the wrong patient class or re-entering a patient that already exists (happens so darn often there's a special interface message just for it) and all of these issues don't just impact the EMR, it impacts the dozens of downstream clinical and revenue systems across your system (ripple effect).  
  
So, modern EMRs try to put a lot of warnings and hard stops to prevent some of these errors, but you can't be too restrictive because some patient is going to present with some kind of exception. As a health system you can realize that all of these things might happen after go-live and try to estimate how often they will happen, and years before the EMR is even set to go live you begin to save your pennies for the eventual revenue hit by say being really nice to your revenue folks and getting them to work OT on closing out those AR days or even say NOT buying that new hospital wing (EMRs can be multi hundred millions to multi billions in total implementation cost).  
  
That's why, when implementing an EMR, you have to do whole enterprise, multidisciplinary, multi year efforts. You have to throw your providers and contractors and full time IT into rooms to argue and hash things out, walk through workflows and present worst case scenarios. You may have to drive your IT contractors and full time to work 50-70 hour weeks for a few years, offering training with commitments but knowing you will lose them after their commitment is up. You have to stagger rollouts with your smaller facilities, if possible, do lessons learned, and do better before you move on to your biggest revenue sources. Above all, you will not be served by ignoring or disrespecting any part of your enterprise (especially not IT) because they will be the ones opening their veins to ensure the effort does not put your whole system under."

"I agree with you too much to really add constructive debate, so instead I'm going to fixate on an interesting side issue

&gt;but the big question is who gets to decide what those are and which are even possible based on the climate, crop and soil type. 

I think organic certification is utter fucking horseshit. I farm mostly organically simply because, in a nutshell, its what's right for me and my land (if you're curious about it, welcome to PM me, but I don't want to side-rant on that right now). However organic-cert would prevent me from using so much material in the form of mulch, compost inputs, etc simply because I can't track exactly where its from. My guiding principle is minimizing waste and pollution, so any certified system that denies me from taking advantage of manure I can't give a complete history for forces me to waste. Or as you alluded to, how the fuck is using bone and blood meal from factory farmed meat sustainable? Yes, it does interact with soil micro-biology different than salt-based nutrients but typically organic has a ""save the world"" attitude to it and depending on factory farming for your soil inputs doesn't strike me as sustainable (or logically consistent).

As well there are organic cert sprays. I've heard many an orchard owner say spraying 8x a year with an organic cert spray is far worse then spraying once with a conventional one. 

I've come to find, even discussing with other farms, that ones farming style is like a religion. Conventional, organic, inbetween or neither everyone thinks every other type of farmer is a fool. I get frustrated by it. On reddit its 10x worse when discussing with people who don't even garden, let alone farm. There are so many factors, considerations, variables, and methods to farming that its shame they get divided up to be grouped with social-political camps. There are a lot of conventional farmers who I could learn oodles from and I'd like to think I'd have a thing or two to share myself.

I work with people who have clerked for state and federal judges, and they all have unanimously stated that judges make their decisions in almost every case exclusively on the briefs filed.

"It's worth noting that [the 2016 SSA Trustees' report](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2016/tr2016.pdf) has trust fund exhaustion in 2034 and afterwards 79 percent of scheduled benefits, under a combined view of OASDI.

&gt; Could privatisation prevent this?

As you can see from your link, tax revenues are already outstripped by outlays, the difference rising until about 2040 and about 2% of GDP in the long run for OASDI (the Trust Fund is still getting bigger though because the interest it earns is larger).  To fill up this gap without changing payroll taxes or benefit levels, the great asset that the SSA has is the Trust Fund, about $2.9T right now.  With GDP [at nearly $19T](https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm), that needs to give a real return of ~$380B in perpetuity that also grows with real GDP, which has recently been rising by about 2%/year.  So you need a real return of about ($0.38T/$2.9T) + 2% = 15% if tax and benefit levels are not to be touched (well, not quite that high because it'll have a few years to build up before 2040 when the demand for return reaches 2% GDP).

There's nothing magical about privatisation in this regard, that's just what the math demands given the two constraints.

Colour me surprised if any private vehicle exists that can provide such returns simultaneously: (a) perpetually; (b) reliably; and (c) on trillions of dollars at the same time.  It does seem rather unlikely since if such a vehicle exists then investors and their funds wouldn't be dilly-dallying with trifles like the stock market or government bonds.

&gt; What alternatives are there?

Relax one or both constraints.

The very simplest option would be to do nothing at all, allow the Trust Fund to exhaust itself and for 71-79% of scheduled benefits to be paid after that depending on who's analysis is more accurate (Social Security being prevented by law from borrowing).

The simplest solutions - in terms of how long a piece of legislation would be - would be to either delete the payroll tax cap entirely (by coincidence this almost exactly cancels out the actuarial deficit of Social Security); or to set the Trust Fund's special bonds that are its exclusive investment to yield a real return of about 15% starting immediately (putting a big dent in the Federal budget).

Payroll taxes could go up to about 15.06% from their current 12.4%, starting now (see the Trustees' report showing an actuarial deficit of 2.66% of taxable income).

Other options include: cross fingers and hope for an unexpected and huge burst of productivity in the economy; make capital gains subject to payroll taxes; implement policies to reshape the economy such that the income distribution curve puts a greater fraction of total payroll underneath the tax cap."

"His thesis that another Blair couldn't win again and that anybody could have won in 1997 is a tad weak, too. David Cameron is a Blair clone, and people said labour couldn't lose in 1992 as well. 

The reality is that Blair-alikes have won every election of the last two decades, by doing exactly what the author then advocates at the end of his article: take the centre ground, promote social mobility and raising quality of life for the masses without stifling innovation and competitiveness. 

Corbyn's politics are indeed awful, a throwback to nationalisation and drudgery completely out of sync with modern Britain, I'm just not sure what the author means by ""labour needs to modernise. No no, not like new labour... they need to appeal to modern Brits with inclusively and offer a better quality of life to the people... erm..."""

They could, but at that point they've got a chain fork, which they could conceivably end up on the wrong side of. Presumably people would start sending test transactions (both valid and invalid under SegWit rules) for a while before they started putting serious money in them, and once they've enforce the SegWit rules for a couple of weeks the economic majority will consider SegWit accepted and failing to enforce them really will put them on the wrong side of the fork.

The whole ""The science isn't clear""-bullshit has been paid by Exxon for years, when they knew exactly how bad it was going to be in the early 80's. They are responsible, they should clean it up, and by proving in court that they have lied to the government and the public for decades, we have a better shot than ever at getting the truth out there."

"Even Supreme Court Justices disagree on the interpretation of the Constitution. This matter isn't entirely objective and non-contentious. 

When it comes to predicting how well the candidates will do their job, you can simply look at their prior work history as well as looking at how well their proposed policies have worked in other countries and time periods. Obama doesn't have any meaningful experience in the private sector. He's never run a business, he's never been a supervisor, and he's never sold any products besides his books. Knowing how the private sector works is a tremendous advantage when you're going to govern in a capitalist economy. How does he know how much certain regulations hurt businesses? He's never owned one. He can look at the data, but the data is easy to misinterprete, either intentionally or unintentionally. According to the data, unemployment has decreased. However, most of these jobs are part-time due to companies being unable to afford healthcare and other benefits for employees. Obama fails to mention this fact. This implies he either doesn't understand the situation the data portrays, or he's hoping Americans won't understand it. So, considering he doesn't understand data and hasn't participated in the private sector,  we have absolutely no reason to believe that he has a lot of knowledge in this area. He doesn't have military experience, either. As for his political career, he was elected by one of the most dangerous and impoverished cities in the country. Chicago also has one of the most corrupt governments in the country. How are we supposed to trust his expertise here? But we elected him anyways, and now we have trillions more in debt, millions still living in poverty, and all the work we accomplished in Iraq has been undone. 

Compared to McCain, he was definitely the worse pick."

"I have to conceed on the kill/time ratio. That was my mistake. However, it still doesn't outweigh the fact that it also has an equal advantage in the hands of good guys. ...And, as I stated before by citing statistics, it is undeniable that guns are used far more often for good than for bad. However, after many of the extemely uneducated and frankly plain ridiculous claims you made on the other topics I mentioned, especially regarding what makes a good home defense gun. (which is an imperative point when discussing AWBs and the like, since the #1 argument to support them essentially boils down to ""you don't need one"")  Also, your cringey definitions and explanations of the word ""infringe"", were, well, cringey. 

Considering your track record in this debate of making frankly ridiculous, veritably false statements, you simply sound arrogant by trying to talk down to me on this one. I'll definitely be more careful with news stories like that in the future, but you certainly need far more work on your research end. LOTS more... 

Debates are good for sharpening an idea - for shaving off false supports and for testing the legitimacy of the idea itself. Just because you prove one or two supporting statements wrong, it does not prove my conclusion wrong. And you have certainly not proven my conclusion wrong. All you've done is knock out one or two unneccessary support legs to it. ...Which I'm glad for, haha. It only refines my ideas. The fact that the only thing you have left is 3 not so significant objections, proves my original ideas to be true. I could conceed on all 3 of these points right now, and my others would still stand. I will conceed two: The one I mentioned before, and the history of the AR.

 ...The latter is sketchy. Even though you appear to be correct on the fact that the rifle was built and sold to militaries at the beginning, there was clearly an obviously recognized niche (which turned out to become a HUGE niche, as it's today's most popular rifle) in the civilian market. After the military marketing drama was over with, they basically said ""Alright, let's milk the potential in the civilian market with this thing."" I'm pretty sure it's safe to say they planned on marketing to civilian markets after they were done figuring out a deal with the military first. The company even stated that it wanted to get recognized in the civilian market first, (though not with their AR-15)  then use that as a boost towards military work.

...Also, none of that is relevant at all. Absolutely none of it. It makes zero difference whatsoever what it was originally designed for. Cars were designed for transportation, yet FAR more people are killed with cars each year than with (note: not *by*) guns. What matters is what it **is** used for now, not what we want it to be used for, or what it was supposed to be used for. 

**You misunderstood my point about attributing motive and intent to a rifle.** I meant to say that motive and intent is attributed to the **use** of it. I thought this was obvious. If my use of wording was confusing then I apologize. People say ""it's a military rifle, meant to be used in war to kill mass amounts of people."" - that is attributing intent to the use of the rifle. They're saying that it's *supposed* to be, and was *intended*, to be used a certain way. This is silly since, obviously, it's innanimate, and is only used as the user intends, not the original creator.

Also, I don't think it's a stretch to say that it was ""originally intended"" for good guys to kill bad guys with. It CERTAINLY fills that role today in the civilian market.

You say you've been in the game for a while, but didn't even know what an AR-15 is good for, and why it beats a handgun for self defense 10 times out of 10. That shows a severe case of echo-chamber, as a quick 2 minute google search could give you all the answers you could ever want on the topic and more. But, you have to be interested in hearing the other side for that. 

Also, I'm glad you think my writing is good, even though you may disagree with it. So thanks. :)"

"if you go snowboarding a lot, use moisturising, emollient products. 

a basic cleanser (anything you like; cetaphil is fine if you don't think it's causing you skin issues. i personally prefer la roche posay, avene, uriage, eucerin, bioderma and dr jart). i'd recommend a hyaluronic acid serum, as the oily/dry sensation you're feeling is most likely dehydration, which means you have a lack of water in your skin. hyaluronic acid is applied to damp skin, under moisturiser. (you can get a hyaluronic acid serum for cheap from the ordinary or from the brand elizavecca which does free shipping through jolse.com). for moisturiser, something rich in the PM (and AM on days you're snowboarding) may really help. la roche posay toleriane ultra or rich, avene skin recovery rich, avene compensating creme rich, bioderma hydrabio rich are all great options. if your budget allows for an oil to be added (rosehip or argan) that would also be beneficial in the PM step. 

for snowboarding, try use a more emollient sunscreen that will protect your skin more from the cold. la roche posay, avene and bioderma have these. "

"You might be histamine intolerant, however if you have used a topical item on your face your skin doesn't like well it will keep on not liking.

Honestly I would step up your anti histamine diet, take your efa's like they are out of fashion, go to your doctors and take it from there.

Another tip is multi layering of products your skin already likes. A hydrating toner? Pat that into your skin 2 or 3 times,  a lighter moisturiser? Layer over damp skin and do that a couple of times. A few drops of oil on damp hands and press that over your skin. Then a layer of occlusive. Let the marinate before smooshing your face into a pillow. That sort of thing. "
"That is not something an insurance company would do. How could you create actuarial tables based on this - and being forced to cover criminal acts.

Further - it erodes the fundamental principle of fairness. You intend to force people to pay for actions committed by others. I have a statement for you. You can take this idea and shove it up your ass. I am responsible for my actions. I am not financially responsible for other peoples actions. You cannot mask this by 'insuring the gun, not the person'. If I am required to purchase insurance, I am required to cover the potential actions of others by your process which is pure bullshit.

The proposal needs to die.  It is unenforceable except for law abiding citizens. Due to 5th amendment protections, you cannot force 'prohibited people' from obtaining insurance for a gun as that would be admitting they were committing a crime.

That was what you just said.  4 years -- not 3.  So voters voted for Obama to have that power for 4 years, from Jan 2013-Jan 2017.  The GOP took that power form him in Feb, 2016 -- almost a full year earlier than the voters in 2012 voted for.

"Pruitt gave a talk this weekend and said that the SRF (state revolving fund), Superfund, and brownfield funding are ""essential"" parts of the EPA and won't be eliminated (SRF is the grants from the EPA to state agencies so they can run their own environmental programs (state DEQs/DNRs), Superfund and brownfields are cleanup funds for companies that polluted the groundwater decades ago and no longer exist). 

The SRF actually saves the EPA a lot of money because they don't have to have a full staff writing permits or inspecting facilities several states away, and companies like it because they don't have to deal with a monstrous federal agency to comply with environmental regulations and can just deal with their state. Superfund is pretty essential because who else is going to clean up toxic contaminants in groundwater that were spilled by a company in the 1920s?

Based on the rollout of pretty much everything else in the federal government, it seems like this administration had no idea what they wanted to do with the EPA since they didn't expect to win the election at all. They seem to still be in the planning phase just about everywhere. 

I feel like this freeze will only last as long as Trump, his staffers, and Scott Pruitt's team can find a common vision. If permits or SRF funds continue to be frozen for a long period of time, business is going to get really upset. The Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act aren't going away. Companies need environmental permits to build. They don't want expansion projects getting held up because the EPA won't fund the states. There's money on the line."

&gt;I'm sure they have a limited jurisdiction on rules that can be imposed on the deliberation of bills on the floor.

There are actually very few limitations on what the Rules Committee can do with a reported rule.  The only one that really appears off limits is they may not remove the ability to have a Motion to Recommit, which is the minority party's last opportunity to amend the bill, at the very end of the process.  These motions are almost never successful.

"So I'll jump in here because I am similar to you.  Also in Los Angeles and very similar financial situation.  My household is income is a bit more and I have no car payment though.  I just went in to escrow so I dont have any real closing experience yet with my particular lender but good so far.

Key here is forget thinking about jumbo and stay in the conventional limits ($636,150).  Your numbers look like you will stay in that.  Keep in mind your down payment is just that and does not include closing costs or reserves.  If you thought your down payment would include those as well, you will be going over the conventional limit.

Forget thinking you will get no PMI.  As others mentioned below, you are paying for it one way or another.  I chose the lower rate and my PMI is $100/month.  Since I'm putting 15% down, I hope to have it gone in a few years.  You can do the math and figure out the difference in a higher interest rate for 30 years vs. paying PMI for a few years and see what works better in your situation.

I also went through the pre-approval with SOFI.  For me, the actual interest rate they quoted ended up being higher than what I saw in their pre-approval process.  It wasn't worth it in the end.  They have no PMI since they dont sell your loan but they are still making up for it in the interest rate like other lenders that do LPMI(lender paid PMI).  I called them out on it once that you can't claim no PMI but do the same thing and their response was that I can always refi to someone else later on at a better rate."

Again no issues. I'm going to be introducing vitamin c and retinol in the next few months and I'll likely be more careful with that unless I see no reaction. It's just not practical for me to wait all of this time between each treatment.

"I use Privacy Badger. It acts like an ad blocker, but only for ads that track you. It uses heuristics though, so it doesn't block anything when you start using it, but as soon as it notices something tracking you, it blocks that."
"That was pretty vague on my part. Play with the ISO and Aperture until you get as close to the calculated shutter speed as possible.

In my book, the Rule of 500 is a guide. For example, I could have shot my 30s photo at a different ISO. Instead of 400 I could have shot at 800 and halved my shutter speed to 15s. You don't *need* to shoot at what the calculation tells you. It just tells you the maximum shutter length before you start to get star trails under any ISO or aperture combo for that focal length.

To quote [someone else](http://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/30263/what-is-the-rule-of-600-in-astrophotography):
&gt; Stars move. Like with any other movement, what we care about is how much they move on the sensor during exposure: A movement that occurs only within a single pixel is not a movement the sensor can capture, i.e. the movement appears frozen.

As cameras get stuffed with more and more pixels, the shorter the photo we'll have to take. But essentially, The 500 Rule helps us calculate the amount of time it'll take stars to travel across one pixel of the imaging sensor. It's not fool proof, you may get some trails at the calculated time which is why I like to shoot somewhere under the maximum time.

The guy I quoted was replying to a topic about ""The Rule of 600,"" which is the same thing as ""The Rule of 500"" but perhaps more relevant when cameras had less pixels. He goes on to provide some pretty useful information into the math of the stuff. Nothing terribly complex, just referencing how fast the sky moves and how that translates to pixels on the sensor.

Oops, totally forgot about your second question. I do tend to shoot at a fast f-stop.


&gt;And if you don't mind another question, is it preferable to shoot night sky with a low f-stop? I always figured you'd want it higher in order to get more stuff in focus since night shots have so much changes in depth, so when getting something in the foreground like a tree you'd want to get both it and the stars in focus as well correct?

I'll link a photo here - I've contemplated submitting it to reddit just was never sure where to - but [this is the shot](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alexglanville/31968662441/) I've been talking about the last few comments. Shot that at f/2.8. Depth of Field doesn't have a huge impact the farther away you focus. I may not get this into words very well so I recommend you download a free Depth of Field calculator app for your phone. You'll be able to see how the depth of field is affected by focal length and focal distance in a clear and visual way."

"This is just my theory but allow me to explain: my positions are short gold and long NVDA.

If you remember what happened last Friday, the moment before Yellen's speech, gold sold off and then rebounded the rest of the day. I interpreted that as a classic buy the rumor sell the news effect, seeing as she basically said she would raise rates ""if the economic conditions call for it"" and Fed Watch went to 82%.

Now, the February jobs report is due Friday at 8:30am. If it's good, Fed Watch will go to 100% and they'll raise rates next week. Gold has already been beat down pretty hard and I think that will continue through Thursday morning. Once the news is out on Friday though, I have no logical idea what's going to happen, but my gut says gold will soar and the market will tank. My portfolio is up 50% over the last day because I am leveraged out of my mind--I don't think much will happen tomorrow and Thursday morning since there won't be any new info. Come Friday morning... who knows what could happen. I need to exit my positions by Thursday as the jobs report will be out before Friday's open. I think it's possible there will be small selloff at Thursday's close if the market pre-empts itself. In any case, I'll be locked in on my charts most of Thursday afternoon and out of everything by the closing bell."

"You can still hire a real estate attorney to review the contract before signing.  A real estate attorney requires much more training than a realtor, so is more likely to find contract issues.  
  
All real estate contracts I have used in buying and selling were standard state based realtor contracts.  99% is standard language, and you are just selecting options.  
  
Pay careful attention to any handwritten sections, as that is where you may see some non standard items.  
  
Since the buyer can cancel the sale at any time during inspection contingency (and effectively cancel with financing contingency, not hard to kill a mortgage), it is not in the seller side's interests to put in major issues.  The most likely problem from seller's side that blows up deal is undisclosed major issues to home.  This is outside of where realtor helps anyway, and would be home inspector's area."

"The atmosphere thins out in a geometric profile, not suddenly. Thinkmof it this way: at any elevation the pressure is the result weight of the air column above it. At sea level the pressure is nominally 14.7 psi; at 14000 feet it's about 1/2 that. See [the curve in this chart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure#/media/File%3AAtmospheric_Pressure_vs._Altitude.png). At 30000 feet it's again halved or about 1/4 sea level. You can extrapolate from that to get an estimate of the amount of air - the number of air molecules - at every elevation.

Now, usevthe SR-71 as an example. At Mach 2.2 (at 60,000 feet forvthis purpose) the leading edges of the plane  are heated red hot by the air friction - the number of air molecules it runs into. It is so hot that aluminum would melt, so much (all?) of the skin is made of titanium. The atmosphere at 60,000 feet is 1/8 as dense as at sea level if I did the math right. So, doubling the elevation a few more times, we get 120,000 feet (about 23 miles or 36 km), then 72 km, then 144 km. At that elevation we are well into the official boundary of 100 km. The density is now 1/8 x 1/2 x 1/2 x 1/2, or 1/64. We can get the same heating by multiplying: Mach 2.2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = Mach 17.6 (the real Mach number varies with density). Mach 1 is close to 1000km/hour. So we are now going at about 17,600 km/hr (11,000 mph) at 144 km elevation and that is hot enough to melt aluminum. But we are not at orbital speed yet, which is about 17,500 mph or 28,000 km/hr.

This is all more complex and I probably used bad math, but with a bit of research and algebra you can find the correct answer.

There are orbital returns that have been designed such that theoretically you can avoid much of the heating problem. The idea is to ""skip"" along the top of the atmosphere, like skipping a ricknacriss a pond. Each short atmospheric bounce takes away some of the speed, and then the vehicle rises up out of the heating zone and cooks for somewhat. Eventually enough speed has been dissipated that the vehicle stays in the atmosphere and flies the rest of the way.

 The Dream Chaser winged lifting body is somewhat in that line, as it uses a low-G return profile, with 1.5 G maximum forces rather than the hot, high-G balloons stic trajectory of the Dragon, Apollo, Soyuz, etc.

*What?* The cultural revolution of the 60s happened precisely because it *did* have millions of adherents, particularly among the youth. There *was* a broad desire and that is the very reason it happened. If you think that the counter-culture of the 60s was pushed by the government, *then you really don't fucking know anything.*

"As a fan of BU, I feel very misrepresentated by this argument. Decentralisation *is* the most precious trait of bitcoin but non-mining full nodes have no effect on this and therefore, neither does the blocksize.

This stems from the misunderstanding  that by checking all the world's transactions instead of just your  own you can somehow reduce the need to trust miners or even ""keep miners in check"".

This is nonsense.  For both SPV and full nodes, the security of your bitcoins relies on the majority mining  power being honest. The mining majority doesn't need to break any rules to steal what they want and therefore, only honest mining power can secure bitcoin.

"Who pays the bill if you are taken to emergency care, cannot deny treatment, and cannot afford to pay? If this is a game of personal responsibility, how do we reconcile that not having health insurance is wagering the tax payer's dime on the chance you never require healthcare you cannot afford. How is that being personally responsible? 

To me the bigger problem is not requiring people to have insurance, it's the cost of healthcare in the first place. This is a difficult problem because the cost goes up as we place more and more stringent requirements, regulations, and risk factors on our incoming doctors. Doubly so as we reduce the number of potential doctors. On the other side of the coin how do we ensure we don't allow quacks to cut off the wrong limb or, worse, kill patients?"

"A fork of any kind to activate BU or SW will be contentious, this is true even if you call your fork a ""soft fork"".

A contentious fork that does not have the backing of the miners (I don't think the miners who are supporting SW are supporting UASF) is even more dangerous because there is the risk that Bitcoin's security will be lost as a result of this kind of fork. 

Further, UASF is going to push the miners towards BU, and will give the miners more of a deadline to activate BU by. 

The result of all this is that the risk of a 51% attack becomes the risk of a 34% attack (a much lower threshold), and there is the risk that minority chain(s) will not very quickly die off, which means the risk of wipeouts is prolonged.  "

"It is an *excellent* idea. I've had a few vertical spreads that I would have won had I placed a [GTC order due to sudden trading spikes](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/4gxtee/how_many_of_you_set_gtc_good_till_cancelled/). It also reminds you of the reasons for placing your trade and your exit points (as selling premium its better to take profits early vs getting greedy and riding to expiration.) 

I don't do it for guarding orders against you. My experience with options is if you're selling any premium it will go against you a lot and that is just something that takes experience to learn and is an unique situation that requires examination each time it happens - is it going against you because fundamentals changed? Is it just whipsawing? And then the method of closing it out can vary and it would be hard to automate - rolling down in same expirations or going out to the future or rolling the untested side later in the future or closer to the tested side, or just taking losses and doing a different trade, etc. 

Also, setting GTC orders to $0.05 for spreads/complex options may mean it won't be filled until it's very close to expiration due to bid-ask spreads. If possible, add at least $0.10-$0.25 buffer depending on the trade and liquidity. And it gets even more complicated if you're doing an iron condor as you're almost always paying ask on all 4 options. With that I prefer to leg in/out of iron condors so probably do an order for each leg and you'll be more likely filled at mid. (Although legging in will cost more if you're on one of those say $5+$.99/contract commission schedules but not an issue on flat contract pricing like with dough rates or on Tastyworks.) If the market gets swingy though it may close out one of the legs early but not the other one so you need some awareness too.  "
"I agree with you regarding their agent being a terrible one. They were breaking contract by having their own interests at heart over their client's. But not all agents are like that. Every business has good and bad providers. You can't and shouldn't generalize all agents as parasites when many just do this job because they like it and want to help their clients. That isn't a fair thing to do. 

Working multiple offers is fine, happens all the time. Stringing someone along is the wrong thing to do. At the very least you can tell them that you have better offers and eject their lowball, then if they want to offer higher you can accept. If not, their loss. "

"Apologies if I missed your point, I assumed you were just citing raw stats of how much of our consumed food is self produced, and then *assuming* this is the case because we simply can't produce any more, rather than *simply because we have demand for more imported food regardless of what we could produce at maximum.* I assumed this because so many others here have done this previously. 

It's extremely hard to estimate how much we can produce *at maximum*, as we haven't tried to do this in centuries, and will never need to or have any reason. From everything I've read, demand is a massively more important determinant to *what* is produced right now, rather than supply or hard resource constraints.

And all the tech stuff that isn't going to China is Silicon Valley, Israel [intel] and the Tiger economies... Britain hasn't been a powerhouse of technological development since the Electronics industry outsourced in the Tory 80s because banking was the only get rich quick industry lol.

this is my point, you think that by using a negative term that someone makes your opinion magically true - they're not sweatshops, the people i've spoken to that worked in them actually enjoyed the experience more than a lot of my friends enjoyed uni, it's a party atmosphere built around work and study, the Chinese love that, it ticks all their boxes! and of course they get to go see their parents and stuff a lot, the companys often facilitate this because filial piety is so important and it's believed workers with good family links are more likely to be reliable and dependable workers.... which is probably true. 
  
These are people who were born to a life of abject poverty in rural china but have come to a mega-city to get an education and make something of themselves, what you call hardship isn't even on their radar - and a lot of them do work hard, learn the skills they need to go on and do something bigger and better like set up their own factory or service, and boy do they get all the help they can need! that's why china's economy is growing and shoring so much. 
  
and no i didn't say that africa wouldn't accept investment because we're murders and rapists i said that the african idea of a european exists with an understanding, often very bias enhanced just as ours is, of history - that in pragmatic situations we can't hope to compete with nations like China or india because they're much richer and more productive than us, they can spend trillions to our millions, we also won't be able to rely on being popular because we aren't popular -- we have basically nothing going for us, we'd be mad to expect a good deal from anyone by the most impoverished, and therefore bad trading partners."

"[This](http://i.imgur.com/zlGnuDO.png) flow chart really explains what to do with your money, starting with the basic budget, debt and moving on into investments/life goals. 


3-6 months of expenses is all you need in a savings account. $8-10k is more than enough, I put 3k in your chequing (will void all fees) and 5-6k in your savings.  Then max your TFSA but you need to take a closer look at your mutual funds. Find out the MER, you may be losing a huge amount of compound interest vs Index/Vanguard/E-series accounts (if it's above 1% MER you're getting fucked) 


The HBP is very niche. Its for people who can't save 5, 10 or 20% of their downpayment and put away money for retirement. You not only don't benefit from it you really shouldn't use it. All you do is take a loan from your account that would be making 5-7% interest so you can buy a house, you have more than enough means to save for a house/build up/take the money from accounts when you'll need it. When you decide you do want a house in what ever city you're in thats when you can start switching from high risk accounts to low risk (GIC/HISA) As a side not, your RRSP/TFSA will likely be maxed at this point, keep the lower earning (GIC/HISA) accounts in your taxable accounts. 



For now, I'd put majority of your money in long term growth and you can pick and choose to withdrawal some of it slowly when its maximizes your return when/if you start getting in the market for a house. Pick a budget number for your 4 months of travel and stick to it, $10-15k sounds pretty reasonable for 4 months off, should get 3-4 trips/6-8 weeks of physically travelling depending on your tastes.

""Children residing in two-biological-parent married families tend to enjoy better outcomes than do their counterparts raised in other family forms. The differential is modest but consistent and persists across several domains of well-being. Children living with two biological married parents experience better educational, social, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes than do other children, on average (e.g., Artis, 2007; Broman, Li, &amp; Reckase, 2008; Brown, 2004; Carlson &amp; Corcoran, 2001; Manning &amp; Lamb, 2003; Teachman, 2008; Videon, 2002). Variation in well-being among children living outside of two-biological-parent married families (e.g., married step, cohabiting, and single-parent families) is comparatively low and often negligible (Artis, 2007; Brown, 2004; Manning &amp; Lamb, 2003). The benefits associated with marriage not only are evident in the short-term but also endure through adulthood (Amato, 2005; Biblarz &amp; Raftery, 1999; Hill, Yeung, &amp; Duncan, 2001; Teachman, 2002, 2004).""

""First, children born tomarried parents who later divorce have worse test scores and aggressive behaviors relative to their counterparts in stable married families. Second, children born to cohabiting parents are disadvantaged across an array of outcomes and this is strongly associated with family stability. While children born to cohabiting parents who transition into marriage are not statistically different from those in stable married families, children born to cohabiting parents who later split do significantly worse than those in stable married families; moreover, unstable cohabitation exacerbates child socio-emotional and health problems relative to stable cohabitation and transition to marriage. Third, children born to single parents have the most consistently adverse outcomes (except asthma), regardless of family stability.""

10/10 for managing to ignore every substantive challenge to monarchic privilege in favor of focusing on technicalities so far.

&gt;And that was also a terrible idea.

So just stick with the terrible idea of keeping billions in non-appreciating stones then? Even just selling the stones and building a giant gold statue of the Queen would be a better investment. Hell, even a copper statute would be a better investment and it could still stroke the ego of the Queen if that's what takes precedent over investing in the countries future.

Also ignore the good idea of using billions in non-appreciating wealth held ""in trust for the nation"" to actually help develop the economy of the nation."

Charlotte meant to protect those that had been noticed, harassed, or even prevented from using gender identity specific bathroom through a city ordinance that was limited to only Charlotte.

The media caught wind and religious and so-called family groups got riled up. Protested and argued against such an ordinance. Charlotte passed it anyway as it is fairly progressive, for a southern city, although was surprised Greensboro didn't have something on the books already.  These groups lost the Charlotte fight, so they took it to the state, who had a knee jerk reaction to a vocal minority complaining and legalized the discrimination of gender identity with regards to bathroom choice. I hate the state superceding the city, I hate the essentially legalization of discrimination, and I hate the speed and underhanded nature with which the state passed and refused to repeal this. Causing many in NC and trying to move go NC, including myself, many problems as companies and organizations pull money, jobs, and in turn taxes out of the state.

"&gt; Isn't the AD=12 12 blocks ahead of the block size you have set

Yes, 12 confirmations from the block greater than your local EB in size

&gt; not just 12 blocks after some random transaction you received

Well the attacker may know the block larger than you EB

&gt; The receiver needs to be running BU.

Indeed

&gt; The fork needs to result in a split with both chains surviving.

No it doesnt, both chains do not need to survive

&gt; The sender must sent payment while the chains are still compatible. (Before the 2MB chain gets longer) and get it to not be included in the a block in the 2MB chain

No they don't.  Also the 2MB chain must always be longer, or it doesnt exist

&gt; The sender must get their payment sent and received on the 1MB chain before the 2MB chain gets longer. This seems like it would be very unlikely without majority hashrate.

No, they can do this while the 1MB chain is shorter

&gt; The receiver would need to have their node set to the recommended EB=1MB and a majority of the BU miners would have to be set to a higher size. (Something the person running the BU node should probably know)

In this example yes, but it could work for another EB...

&gt; The sender would have to know the 2MB chain would eventually out pace the 1MB chain or at least have a good probability of it to bother.

Not really, the cost of trying this attack is almost zero.  Might as well flood the mempool with hundreds of double spend attempts.


&gt; The sender needs to know the receiver is running a BU node

This is why nobody should run BU

&gt; Unless this person is just spamming transactions everywhere hoping to come out ahead.

No reason not to do this...

That falls right in the middle of ""could go either way"" for me. With the condo purchase you are leveraging 5X, so you can make a better ROI if the real estate market goes even or good/great, but you are taking a much higher risk if the real estate market goes down or busts. Leverage is great when it works, but sucks when it doesn't. If you are young and risk hungry and happy to deal with the reantals/problems/etc, it probably makes good sense.

What's his process on blue chips? What techslnicals does he watch?
"To be clear at the present, there is **no definitive evidence to support that any particular measure is effective in preventing AD** ([Study A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16917203/), [Study B](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15380154/), [Study C](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17764625/),[NIH News Release](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/independent-panel-finds-insufficient-evidence-support-preventive-measures-alzheimers-disease), and finally [NIH Consensus ](https://consensus.nih.gov/2010/alzstatement.htm)). There are certainly promising results coming in from around the globe in areas of intellectual engagement, diet, use of cannabinoids, etc, but these results are largely inconsistent and require further clinical trials.

Additionally as I mentioned in my original post, there is no cure for AD - only treatments that target developing symptoms in a palliative nature and thus are not considered ""maintenance treatments"" because they do not hold the disease at a constant level/state in the body or delay the progression of the disease.

It is written ""a physician should never administer a test to a patient without a plan on what to do if the test comes back positive"". 

So with this in mind let's say you are a 30 y/o Male who comes into clinic with concerns about a family history significant for a maternal grandmother with AD diagnosed at age 65 and a paternal grandfather with AD diagnosed at age 67. You undergo this genetic profile test and it determines you have a high likelihood of being diagnosed with AD at age 64. 

What do you do with this information? Nothing you can do will prevent the disease from occurring and nothing you can take will cure it. So now you are just going to live for the next 34 years with the horrible knowledge you have a high likelihood of developing symptoms and eventually dying in 3-9 years post age 64 from such a terrible disease? Would you be better off not knowing the likelihood of developing AD at 64 if the outcome of knowing vs not knowing was exactly the same? 

This is the debate of offering such a test like PSA or Age Predicted AD - at what point does the harm to the patient outweigh the benefit? Is it appropriate to give patients clinical tests from which they will not (at least currently and directly) benefit from or in which the harms of the test outweigh the benefits? 

I am actually really curious what Dr. Andreassen's team has discussed on this matter as I am sure it has come up before. I am hoping there is a benefit not readily obvious that Dr. Andreassen can shed some light on for us :)"
This sounds completely made up 
"&gt;And taking 50% of individuals income at the threat of violence isn't extreme? The government isn't robin hood here, they are the bad guys.

The money they take from that supremely rich person goes to support countless things, including feeding the poor and keeping children from dying of horrible diseases.

&gt;Wouldn't it even be safe to say if welfare were cut the people now with extra income would try to create jobs for those that were on said welfare? Seems like an economic gain to me.

I don't think it's safe to say anything of the sort. It's possible, but it's not a certainty.

&gt;I don't really understand why you'd find it hard to believe people wouldn't help those starving in the streets.

I'm sure plenty of people would help. But by the sheer breadth of the issue, it's virtually inevitable that charity would fail to support everyone where the government would.

&gt;Do you not associate yourself with people that help out in the community? Have you not seen the community come together even on reddit to achieve great things? Never seen a go fund me page?

Yeah, like that time Reddit caught the Boston Bom- oh wait, that was just some brown kid who'd been dead for weeks.

Are you just fucking with me at this point?

&gt;You only achieve the moral high ground by being charitable with your own money, not other peoples.

The moral high ground isn't going to keep people from dying of preventable illnesses because they don't have the money to go to a doctor (i.e., something that happens all the time in the largest, most sophisticated economy on Earth because it lacks universal healthcare)."
"It looks ok to me.

A couple of things that I would consider:

1. 22% in UK equities, you are definitely overweight here.
2. 20% in bonds and your time horizon, this is very aggressive. I personally would have this a lot higher, a minimum of 40% in bonds. In it's current state, it's a real possibility that this portfolio could be negative in 5-10 years.
3. Your bond duration is too long for your time horizon. 'Vanguard Global Bond Index Fund GBP Hedged Acc' would likely be a better choice, however it includes international bonds.
4. You don't need international bonds. Gilts are among the safest in the world. All international bonds will do is increase your costs with a need to hedge out the currency risk. However, with your time horizon there are very limited short duration bond funds. You may also consider holding your risk free asset in cash. There is potential to earn higher interest in cash than in short duration gilts at present.

You could also look at Vanguard Target Retirement 2025 Fund - Accumulation (GBP). This would personally be my choice if I was looking to invest with your time horizon. This is what Vanguard would consider as the ideal allocation with a time horizon of 8 years and it will be automatically re-balanced as time progresses. Even if you choose not to use this, it would be worthwhile to look at their allocation."

"IMO this has the right idea but the wrong execution in regards to early superannuation access. Super may be a great forced system for a lot of people to force savings, but for me personally forced retirement age that can change any time (and therefore change when you can access the money) is an insane. 

Imagine if I contribute 10% of my take home income to my super account, then imagine if the government increases the retirement age even though I was planning to retire at 60. I'm fucked and imo it's bullshit. 

At the same time letting people access the money whenever they want is also really not a great move. "

"I belive most police officers around the world genuinely wants what is best for the public and wants to uphold the peace. 
It's just so many bad apples in the US that ruins it, and institutionalized corruption and power mongering that keeps it running. 

I also genuinely belive (and is supported by many studies) that the US way of sentencing criminals for extended periods for minor crimes works against the system. For example, if a criminal is stealing to keep himself fed, and he knows if he gets caught he will face 30-40 years in prison, why wouldn't he do whatever is absolutely necessary to not get caught ? If he knows he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison, does it matter if he is serving a sentence for stealing / assault or for killing someone? 

If he instead faced 3-5 years for example, in a decent prison (US prisons are ridiculous and should be reworked as they are rife with corruption too) he might not want to kill someone if he can avoid it, and just serve his time.

"You just need a handful of engineers do tape out an ASIC. And of course some money, the biggest cost burden are masks. For 16nm it is not cheap, but for a venture capitalist it is peanuts.   

The design complexity is not a challenge at all when you compare it to SoCs (mixed signal, memory) which go into cheap cell phones. A sha256 algorithm is a simple synchronous digital design and the operating  conditions are very relaxed. The algorithm is not a secret nor is it protected by IP rights. The design is already open source, it just needs to be mapped on a 16nm or below process. Engineering will be a very streamlined process.

This is incorrect. It even mentions it specifically in one of the high carb vs low carb diet studies mentioned in the comments.  Even the high carbers are producing ketones in their urine.  People burn fat on high carb low fat diets all the time. They do on high fat as well.  As long as there is a calorie deficit.  Personally I've done both keto and plant based. I lost weight on both.  Plant based was easier for me to stick to and seems healthier because of all the healthy plants I eat.

IMO, the conversation between the WH and the FBI is indicating that there was a warrant for a tap that was carried out legally by the FBI. If that's true, it would mean that Trump's tweet was hasty and incorrect. In that event, I've heard people discussing the possibility of a libel suit, but I don't claim to know the legal requirements around that term.

Seeing that he was the president, I find it likely that he knew about it before the story came out. But what does that matter?

"&gt; Migrant workers are competing from jobs. They also usually need additional support from the local community to function (teaching the language, cultural basics, how government functions work etc)

Do you have a source for this, and how much this figure is compared to what they pay in local taxes?

I have not seen the data but I would suspect the idea that there's any significant amount of money being spent by local government on teaching EU migrants English is a fancy.

&gt;Mirgation may be a net positive to the economy, and people will be happy if folks want to join their communities and things are paid back long term, but with the high levels of wealth innequality a lot of those taxes just aren't seen in poorer communities

Then its the governments fault for not making proper use of the money migrants generate. Getting rid of migrants isn't going to make the government suddenly prioritize those poor areas.

Less taxpayers is not going to help, neither is higher costs of goods that are made cheap by migrant labour (i.e. food).

The kind of areas you're talking about are already significant net beneficiaries from the national treasury so I also don't buy that they lose more in local costs than they do in national spending. Happy to change my mind if I see some data.

"I am an ASE certified master mechanic among other things. It looks like a great product, but buy good insurance. Vehicles in general are not designed to be load carrying with shifting loads on top. Most vehicles have crash protection for passengers so there is some structural integrity. However, I would bet that you will have cracked windshields, broken side door glass, and risk the structural integrity of the crash protection inner cage. Hefty Americans climbing up and down small SUVs....yeah I don't think that will be a long term win. 

The first time one of the smaller vehicles rolls and a fatality occurs a lawyer will be all over a product that may have interfered with the structural integrity of the aluminum passenger cage. 

If it has some sort of fold down load bearing jacking system that removes weight off of the vehicle and in turn your product only uses the vehicle as an anchor then you would be good. But your costs would be a lot more. 

Food for thought. 

Edit: BTW the difference between the AHA and the OP's product is the AHA sits in what was engineered to be a load bearing part of a vehicle. The weight is on the suspension and chassis of a truck that was engineered to carry loads. The OP's product sits on a passenger compartment that was engineered to protect occupants from injury during crashes. The liability is completely different. "

"The fact that shareblue is essentially a rebranded version of Correct The Record, a Clinton funded super-pac, both founded by David Brock, to spread liberal propaganda online. Notably on Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. 

The attitude toward blatant propaganda on this sub is frankly disgusting. Trump is playing the media, and the media is playing you.

Let's look at the series of events. Spicer holds press briefing in his office. Office too small for the usual 100 reports in the Brady briefing room, so he invites a pool, of which all major networks were represented. He invites a few more on top of that totaling around 15-20. 70-80 of the usual reporters not in attendance. 

The media, of course singles out CNN and NYTIMES. No mention of the other 80 reporters not invited. 

Shareblue (liberal propaganda organization) takes it a step further and says the few liberal organizations weren't invited because they're investigating ties to Russia. Which is of course bullshit. After MONTHS of the media, the Obama admin. FBI, CIA, global interests desperately trying to prove Trumps relatively underfunded campaigns collusion with Russia, we're now a month into his presidency and no evidence. Oh and Assange still says Russia wasn't the source of DNC emails. But Russia is all the democratic party has left."

"Please don't feel rude, I never heard of topricin and I will look into. Tell you the truth, not sure if I'm not too far gone though. 


 I have suffered from one source of pain or another after breaking a couple of vertebrates and four ribs near my spinal column in a car accident in the late 80s when a limo hit me in the drive side of my 1975 Camaro. Lucky or not I survived only to have my spine slowly fall apart. 


I started popping discs in 1991 and the spine has deteriorated a tremendous amount over the years. I have had lower back surgeries and my neck fused. When my neck collapsed one day I developed Hydrocephalus and had less than successful VP shunt surgery also.

I have tried many things over the years but my entire spine has just kept on getting worse and worse. Now that I have reached my 50s arthritis and degenerative disc disease has ravaged my spine and knees. So from head to toe I am in constant entire body pain.

With all that even with pain medication I was always in pain but the oxycodone did allow me to function somewhat and at least be a part of my family and children's lives. Now three years later after weaning myself of oxycodone I can not function at all. After my wife helps me dress all I can do is just sit or lay in my bedroom all day long.         

Sorry for the long rant and please don't think I'm looking for sympathy. 


What I am looking for is understanding and empathy and I hope people realize that some people do need stronger medications.

I think we should not demonize those medications or the people who depend on them. Sure I am bias but no one else other than chronic pain patients are speaking on our behalf.

"&gt;Not only migrants but other non-Western great powers and of course the 1.3 billion people who aren't affiliated with ISIS yet are still Muslim.

No mention of ISIS anywhere in my statements. Only about Muslims. The Q'uran verses I show is what Muslims worship and believe, not statements from ISIS.

Also, what you quoted and responded to don't relate to each other. The nation still doesn't collapse because 1.3 billion Muslims are suddenly being treated according to their actions. 


&gt;It destroys any semblance of Western liberalism

Not even close. Even in the most extreme version of this, lets say a complete police state in any of these socialist/democratic/capitalist/communist countries, they still hold modern liberal values;

* Women are still equal to men

* You can still worship whatever you want, even Islam

* You can still be gay/trans/whatever you want

* You can still probably be whatever you want (excluding the socialist and communist countries)


Loss of personal privacy can be equated to a loss of potential liberty at the hands of abuse, but not equality, which is the foremost proponent of liberalism.


So we finally get to the truth, boiled down after all those false equivalencies and hyperbole, and guess what? It isn't an argument. It's logically absurd in all forms.

[Christianity, give it a read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian)

&gt;A Christian (pronunciation: Listeni/Ààkr…™ Ét É…ôn/ or /Ààkr…™stj…ôn/) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, **monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ**. ""Christian"" derives from the Koine Greek word Christ√≥s (ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term mashiach.[6]
&gt;While there are diverse interpretations of Christianity which sometimes conflict,[7][8] they are united in believing that **Jesus** has a unique significance.[7] The term ""Christian"" is also used as an adjective to describe anything associated with Christianity, or in a proverbial sense ""all that is noble, and good, and Christ-like.""[9]"

We got the estimate, padded the estimate number to the seller (they didn't ask for receipts), and they countered the repair cost amount to something just under the actual quoted price. When the repairs were done, I had to pay the workers upfront, then the money was discounted on the house itself.

"I wouldn't use LegalZoom.  They overcharge for everything.  I learned it after it was too late.  DO NOT PAY LEGALZOOM TO FILE FOR AN EIN!  Getting an EIN is FREE through the IRS.

They overcharged on my state's filing fees.  I signed up for the 30 day package and even though I was told it would probably come sooner, it came exactly on the 30th day.  I suspect they were dragging their feet and holding onto everything just because I paid less.

They made it seem like I was getting a super-detailed package, but what I got was actually a very generic set of Operating Agreements.

I'm also paying $159 a year for the Registered Agent.  I'm not sure how I would find one of those on my own so I don't know if it's worth it going through LegalZoom for that or somewhere else.

IncFile does the same thing and they charge less.  They even give you your first year free for a registered agent.  After that, it's $99 a year.  Still cheaper than LegalZoom.

Once I realized what I got and how easy it would be to file through my state on my own (being cheaper overall and that I'm exempt from filing fees as a Veteran), I started kicking myself.  I will never use LegalZoom if I need to do this again.

The only reason LegalZoom has the reputation it does is because they do the most advertising so everyone turns to them first.  If you're doing your research first, then you are a step ahead of a lot of people who just blindly follow the tv ads.  Figure out how to do it on your own.  Everyone is saying how simple it is.

"Maybe infrastructure funding. *Maybe.*

The ACHA was explicitly designed and intended to repeal the biggest Democratic legislation in decades. It was never going to get a single Democratic vote, and neither the White House nor the House GOP ever pretended to try swinging any.

I expect the same will happen to any budget or tax bill that comes up. Trump's proposed budget guts numerous Democratic favorites, including the EPA, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, energy tax credits for low-income households, NIH research, foreign aid, domestic aid programs like Meals on Wheels, job assistance for the poor and elderly, wildlife conservation, need-based college scholarships, and earth science; all in favor of enormous spending projects that Democrats were never going to vote for in the first place. Factor in Trump's proposed tax reform, which would bring the US debt load on par with total GDP by 2022 ‚Äî and that's a conservative estimate ‚Äî and he could once again lose a good number of deficit hawks in the Republican Party.

Infrastructure spending is about the one place where the Democrats and the Republicans are anywhere near the same page, but there you're probably going to run into sectional rivalries. Whose bridge gets rebuilt first, when do my state's pipes get fixed, that kind of thing. Also, as other commenters have noted, Trump's negotiating style is not known for producing long-term partnerships; lawmakers on both sides may be inclined to deny him his agenda out of pure spite.

And you'll probably still see pushback from deficit hawks."

"&gt; The majority of those 1.3 billion Muslims live in third world countries.

Do you know what a third world country is? I want you define it right now.

&gt; Also a large amount of Muslims are in terrorist groups, ISIS is estimated to be 30,000 Muslims

That's not very large. At least not compared to 1.3 billion. I'll even do the math.

According to the math. 2.307692307692308e^5 amount of Muslims are members of ISIS. That's less than 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent.

&gt; Al Qaeda thousands of Muslims

That's even less than ISIS.

&gt; Boko Haram etc 

Boko Haram is a few thousand, all the other are far less. So even if we factor them in, less than 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent of Muslims belong to a terrorist organization. Those odds are so low that not even Batman thinks they're a threat.

&gt; If only say 0.1% of Muslims are active terrorists in the world that is still 1.6 million

Good thing that less than 0.1% of Muslims are NOT active terrorists. As my math shows.

&gt;  Keep in mind that most countries populations only about 1% of them serve in the military anyway, so any oppressive or genocidal regime worldwide it was technically only a minority of their population who was doing the violence.

Good thing that we don't punish the entire population of countries and instead only go after the leaders and war criminals. We didn't convict every German person in Nazi Germany of committing war crimes during the Nuremberg trials. We went after the ones who actually did it.

&gt; In the United States during slavery, it was only about 1 to 5% in most estimates of Southerners who actually owned slaves. I mean by your logic, if only a tiny minority of a group does something bad why should the group be blamed?

I 100% agree with this. Most Southerners were not involved in the slave trade. What specific point are you trying to make here? Quite honestly I find the support of The Confederacy in the Southern part of the United States to be confusing. The Confederacy wasn't just bad for Black People, it was bad for poor Whites (who tend to be the ones that like the Confederate Flag) as well. White people not only didn't benefit from the system of slavery (in fact they suffered because they couldn't compete slave labor and were often unemployed), but during The Civil War it wasn't the rich slave owners that went to the front lines. They drafted poor Whites and sent them to go fight and die. 

In fact if you think about it, Rich White people making poor Whites suffer for their own cause by convincing them ""we're all in this together"" is a very common  and tragic story in our history. But I digress.

&gt; Also dissent against the current world order leads to imprisonment as well. If people post right wing ""hate speech"" online in Germany they get thrown into prison and investigated.

I found the law!

&gt; In Germany, Volksverhetzung (""incitement of popular hatred"") is a punishable offense under Section 130 of the Strafgesetzbuch (Germany's criminal code) and can lead to up to five years imprisonment.[32] Section 130 makes it a crime to publicly incite hatred against parts of the population or to call for violent or arbitrary measures against them or to insult, maliciously slur or defame them in a manner violating their (constitutionally protected) human dignity. Thus for instance it is illegal to publicly call certain ethnic groups ""maggots"" or ""freeloaders"".[33] Volksverhetzung is punishable in Germany even if committed abroad and even if committed by non-German citizens, if only the incitement of hatred takes effect within German territory, e.g., the seditious sentiment was expressed in German writing or speech and made accessible in Germany (German criminal code's Principle of Ubiquity, Section 9 ¬ß1 Alt. 3 and 4 of the Strafgesetzbuch).

Seems to me that it doesn't specify right-wing stuff at all. I think hate speech in general is banned, regardless of your political ideology. I can actually understand this position, especially for Germany. They're one of the few countries in the world that learned from the mistakes of their past and are trying to prevent it.

&gt;  If people question certain historical events they get thrown into prison.

Such as?

&gt; If people openly state an opposition to mass immigration they are shamed and have their lives ruined in the United States,

1. That's not a social issue.

2. Opposition to mass immigration [is a divisive issue.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/03/young-people-less-likely-to-view-iraqi-syrian-refugees-as-major-threat-to-u-s/) Did half the United States have their lives ruined? Also the current president opposes mass immigration and he's doing just fine, er, relatively speaking. I don't see evidence where voicing opposition to mass immigration ruins your life. I mean sure you'll have people criticize you, but that applies to basically any political opinion really.

&gt; especially if a celebrity or someone high in status was to say it.

1. Got a good example?

2. Basically every right-wing pundit and politician opposes mass immigration. Are all their lives ruined? Boy, having a ruined life sure isn't the same way it used to be.

&gt; Also if we look at the statistics it's not 20-50 people getting killed by a Muslim extremist. If we start count from 2000 and divide it by 17 years and look at all the attacks alone in just America/Canada/Europe we are still talking about close to a thousand people per year.

Source? Because 9/11 killed 2,753 people. That's more people that have died than all of the other Islamic terrorist attacks in the last 17 years combined. [source](https://ourworldindata.org/terrorism/)

Now of course many terrorist attacks are not done by Muslims. I know the UK had serious problems with the IRA and the bombings they committed. There was also that issue with The Troubles. In which the hundreds of people killed may be classified as terrorism depending on your point of view.

&gt; If last year 266 black people were killed by cops ( and the majority were justified as an armed violent suspect ) and let's say 10 were unjustifiable deaths, and this causes people to suggest changing laws for the police, and causes blacks to riot and commit terror attacks.

1. Does that mean you agree with Black Lives Matter?

2. The issue of people getting killed by cops isn't so much the death rate, but the lack of accountability. Black people were protesting because often time police officers aren't charged when they commit an unjustified shooting. Even if they are charged, they often don't even go to trial. If it does go to trial, they are likely to be found not guilty. Of course the mainstream media doesn't do a good job representing this so I understand if you're a bit confused why Black people are so angry.

(PS, I'd personally appreciate it if you didn't call us ""the Blacks"". It's a bit dehumanizing. Just call us Black people).

&gt; Then I think 100's of innocent random people being killed by Muslim terrorists ( when they shouldn't have been killed ) is a valid enough reason to justify changing our immigration laws.

1. You're not just saying we should change our immigration laws, you're advocating a straight up ban on Muslims. Your analogy to Black Lives Matter and similiar protests/criticisms of the police is completely flawed in terms of scope. People who criticize police brutality aren't saying ""NO MORE NEW COPS!"" Any comparison you can make here falls short due to the extreme and draconian ""solution"" you propose the problem.

2. A police officer is not a religion, ethnic group, gender, or race. Police officers are state employees and are given a fair amount of authority and trust. Therefore they are held to a higher level of standard. A Muslim and a police officer nowhere near comparable. Lets not even get started on the fact that most people are Muslim because they were born into the religion. You aren't born into the police squad. You're also not paid to be Muslim. You are paid to be a police officer. Paid via the taxpayer dollars of the citizens you police. 

Like I see what you're trying to do. You're trying to make these analogies to movements or opinions that you assume I agree or sympathize with. But the problem here is that your analogies...don''t really make much sense. I mean you're literally comparing Apples and Oranges here.

&gt; American society on the other hand does not need Muslims or more immigration

Actually immigration is what's keeping our population stable. Without immigrants we'd have a bit of a population crisis in which we have an aging population and not enough children being born (such as what you see in Japan). So we kinda do need immigrants, at the very least for population stability.

That's not [even mentioning how often immigrants tend to be some of our most brilliant inventors and businessmen.](http://fortune.com/2014/06/02/fortune-500-immigrants/)

[Extra Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianstadler/2015/09/08/5-reasons-why-immigrants-make-great-entrepreneurs-to-boost-an-economy/#7acbdcfe729e)

&gt; as we already have 300 million people

Yeah population numbers aren't important. It's the demographic behind those numbers that are important. For example, occupation, age, gender, etc,. 

&gt; were successful and a world super power before we changed our immigration laws to allow Muslims to enter the country.

1. Our immigration laws were not changed to allow Muslims to enter the country. Muslims have always existed in this country (yes even in the year 1776) and could always immigrate here. 

2. That logic can be literally used to justify getting rid of anything. ""I don't like video games. We were a successful and world super power before we had video games around. Lets ban video games!""

The problem with your argument is that you fail to bring up a convincing argument as to why Muslims are so threatening that it justifies harming them. Some of them being jerks is not a good enough reason."

I'm just trying to understand the logic of people who have made that statement to me.

After sorting through many facts that have been presented to me. 

Does anyone have a completely objective explanation of the logic behind how believing one thing that is unproven unintelligent and believing another thing that is unproven is smart?"

"""Average"" is basically always less useful than ""median"" in non-scientific contexts. You don't have to make it more complicated than that.

So always call out averages when they aren't close to the median."

"The vendor reserve is set prior to auction. The reserve is (in most states) required to be within 10%. This means 10% more than the guide typically. Many bidders are attracted to a cheaper price guide and increase competition and final price hence 'under quoting'. In your 430k example, the vendor will most likely have a reserve of 470k approx. it's likely that since 430k is good value, many people will come and bid with the final price at market value (might be passed in, might be sold at 600k - who knows). An offer is whatever you like to give. If it's rejected, all you do is turn up on the day... "

"On the allocations, they look fine. You'll want your allocations to match across your whole portfolio (if they all have the same target), so if you plan to go with a little less Cdn, or change the amount of bonds, then just keep everything in sync.

It's much more important that you invest than it is that you invest perfectly. There's a lot of retired people that invested only in Cdn, often in mutual funds charging over 2%, and made out okay.

It's also perfectly fine to not want to manage everything in Questrade and learn this all yourself. You very likely have the option of transferring in to the work one your own RRSP and possibly TFSA. They don't end up locked like the work ones. So if you really wanted you could probably move everything here so there's only one place to look at.

Then if you change companies in 3 years and you feel more comfortable then you can move things to Questrade then.

"&gt;criminals operate by different rules to us.

This is true. However, there's also the responsibility to establish criminality - getting the wrong guy does happen occasionally, so accountability *must* be high to prevent innocent involvees being harmed. That makes the job of policing a difficult one, indeed, but it also means that both the police and the public have an element of protection. 

The keyword here is context. Bobby in the street has an element of power over the members of the public he shares that street with, but this is power *in the moment*. Yes, he could easily arrest someone on a trumped up charge and spoil their day, but eventually bobby is held accountable. The accountability is *after the action*, meaning that it is reactive rather than preventative. 

That accountability, being reactive, means that there is potential, where a weapon is involved, for irreversible action to be taken. Regardless of the officer's intention, if someone dies there is little that can be done about it. Although an officer using a weapon out of keeping with lawful operation is nigh unheard of in Britain, the risk remains, and for this reason public preventative accountability (smartphones etc) is something I agree with, where the camera operator does not interfere with operation. This form of accountability, whilst difficult to manage, is a form of assurance that unlawful weapons use *won't* happen, at least in theory, so in that regard I agree with it. 

It's a difficult line to toe. I do understand how it can be difficult to maintain policing standards, and to maintain effectiveness, but at the same time the addition of firearms officers to our streets is only going to exacerbate that problem. "

"It's inappropriate sure, but when you take away a persons livelihood for propositioning another *once* then you're criminalizing normal human behavior.  

'Sexist' is just a word. It's now sexist to ask for sex? You think she would have a leg to stand on legally in Norway, or France, or Spain? No, she'd be laughed out of court - a question is not harassment. Repeated attempts, threats, freeze-outs, touching - those are harassment.  

I didn't get a jacket, that's sexism. Fucking hell. The world's gone to shit. You know what this does? It makes it likely that the next time a man and a woman apply for the same job the man gets it, because guess what - men are mistreated at workplaces too - they just suck it up. Imagine a man going to the press because he didn't get a jacket. Or because some manager propositioned him for sex once.  

This entitlement is becoming more and more common. It wouldn't happen 10 years ago that a woman propositioned would go out in public - because she's know there would be no sympaty for her 'plight'. And look now - everyone is up in arms. And frankly this is nothing but a spit in the face of women who actually are harassed at work.  

This is the core of the opposition against PC culture, ain't it - that proponents have a vision about how humans *should* act, and how the world *should* be - and they're willing to legislate, shame, harass, discriminate, and even act out violently to push their vision into reality.  

Diversity means you have to deal with the kaleidoscope of human personalities - but it has come to mean outside appearance only - don't you dare think or act or speak differently.

""Finally, we saw a high profile blow up from Acacia Communications, another optical components company, which lowered guidance for the current quarter and saw its shares get whacked hard as a result. Acacia said that the weak guide was the result of weakness from one single customer in the DCI space. Investors in the entire optics space took that as a systemic issue rather than the company specific issue (specific to Acacia only) that it really is.""

At that speed they'd get there in ~180 years, but probes that small would be limited in what they could do, and it would take another 40 years for the signal to get back.

"1. Bookkeeping is made easier by skipping the ""printed check"" part. Programs still all keep records of payments, when and to who, and they're more easily traceable because you take out the extremely archaic mail part. How often do you hear ""the check is in the mail"" to explain late payment? Electronic transfer is instant, and the same data and accounting is kept.

2. Large sets of payments are sent with a remittance where I'm from, if it's check or direct deposit they still send through a detailed breakdown of where the money goes.

3. Other people lagging behind is not a good argument for checks.

4. Most fees are paid via invoice and then direct deposit at a later date, cash and check are also available for those who wish to do it the hard way.

5. You don't send bank statements, you send a copy of the confirmation that a payment has been made to x account for y dollars. Just as easy as sending a copy of a check, but you just email a screengrab, no scanning or mailing needed.

6. Again, direct deposit keeps all the same accounting data as physical checks, but it shows down to the second when the money was transferred, and has way more information than a paper trail. If you desperately want something physical, you can even print this info out at a later date.

7. Why does that matter? If someone tells you an account number, 99% of the time in my business it's either via text or email. If they tell you to send it somewhere and you send it there, that's payment made. Having a check stub is no proof at all, I can write whatever I want on one of those. You can't fake a bank confirmation.

&gt;I think it's real dismaying that y'all look at someone literally saying that 'the left could end this acrimonious debate right now by making abortion wholly illegal outside of extreme circumstances' and that the only argument for not actively stripping women's rights and bodily autonomy is 'pro-choicers want to have a lot of consequence-free sex' and go 'oh well jeez they're just expressing a pro-life viewpoint, nothing wrong with that.'

1. The comment in question *explicitly put rhetorical distance between the commenter and the pro-life argument in question*. You are ascribing it to the poster even though it was explicitly disclaimed. Like, the very first sentence of that reply, emphasis mine: ""The entire debate essentially hinges on one issue - **the pro choice side don't see** fetuses as human life."" Not ""I don't see"". ""They don't see"". So, no, you are factually incorrect when you describe /u/iDareToDream as making that claim about what ""the only argument"" is. That is a strawman, and it is disrespectful.

1. Unless you think that there's something inherently moddable about the opposing viewpoint, then there is no plausible reason to take offense to people saying ""well if your side just ceded this issue entirely there would be no more need for debate"". Like, how do you take offense at a tautology? 

1. The comment in question **objectively did not** argue that ""pro-choicers want to have a lot of consequence-free sex"" is, as you put it, ""the only argument for not actively stripping women's rights and bodily autonomy"". It argued a) that abortion *doesn't fit into* said rights/autonomy; b) argued that the reason is to enable such sex *but said nothing about a supposed desire to have a lot of it*. You are misrepresenting that. I know **you** think abortion is fundamentally a rights/autonomy issue, but the person you're arguing with does not. Accordingly, from that point of view, it's not ""the only argument for not actively stripping rights/autonomy away"" because from that point of view *there is no proposal to strip rights/autonomy away*.

1. Your tilde marks around ""politely"" are not respectful. Yes, the other argument was polite. You currently are not being polite."
"I'm sure it's just a coincidence that five separate people in Trump's campaign and administration have had to step down due to inappropriate ties with Russia.

- What are the benefits?
- How is it the same or different from other rewards programs?

How YOU execute something is not the same as how anyone else executes. You need to also be clear and concise in explaining how YOU are going to execute to deliver the benefits you claim to offer people.

"It's interesting. The easiest way to murder a guy, especially in a country like Malaysia, is to use a gun and a scooter/motorcycle.

To use an exotic chemical like VX means that want to send a message. They specifically want people to know they did it. But I have a hard time seeing the advantage in that.

They're already under so many sanctions that things could hardly get worse in terms of international relations.

Kim Jong Il's philosphy of Juche is all about ""self reliance"" which means fuck what the world thinks, we'll do it live.

"&gt; 1) What is normal hourly rate for an employee of a bootstrappish company

It depends on what they do and how well they do it.

&gt; 2) What is the normal distribution for a share % for one of the ""founding"" member.

Again, it depends on how irreplaceable they are to the company. If they are doing work any contractor could pick up at a comparable rate, you don't need to give them shares. If they bring some special/irreplaceable value to the table, their equity compensation should reflect that.

&gt; 3) Do founding members usually get dilutable or non-dilutable shares?

IMO non-diluting shares are always a bad idea.

&gt; The Russian state-owned news website Sputnik has applied for a White House hard pass and is seeking membership in the White House Foreign Press Group in order to become a part of pool rotations.

&gt; Among the criteria to become a WHFPG member is a White House-approved hard pass, membership in the White House Correspondents&amp;#039; Association, and State Department verification that the network is based in another country.

&gt; Feinberg said as far as he knows, he is the first Sputnik correspondent to apply for a White House hard pass in order to be a regular presence at the White House.

&gt; Nye, the former host of the beloved children&amp;#039;s science program Bill Nye the Science Guy, has since become a frequent and prominent commentator about scientific topics, especially the perils of a warming planet.

&gt; On the topic of climate deniers, Nye said that they suffer from cognitive dissonance, describing how these people have a psychological disorder preventing them from facing reality.

I understand you and your friend have done it right (congrats on this) and have created a successful business but bear in mind that not everybody will manage it. It is also not the same thing to target a wide audience (e.g. SnapChat) or a small niche you already know very well. In a more uncertain market, having some methods such as the Lean StartUp will reduce the risk of launching a product nobody cares about.

**The Clergy Project: Navigating Reality Together**

*Mohler might not like the fact that TCP or any of our deconverted religious leaders exist. He might find it frustrating that there are Christian ministers out there preaching in churches even as they secretly harbor disbelief. He might find the news of such truths embarrassing to his religion.*

*But the truth is that we‚Äôre here whether he likes it or not. Though not all of our project participants come from Christian traditions, the truth is that most of us do. So the truth is that we truly believed in his god, and yet claims of his god‚Äôs existence ultimately left us unsatisfied. And the truth is that now we‚Äôre moving on. Some are taking their time, as is their right. And some may continue serving to retirement. This is their choice as well. And if Mohler‚Äôs god is real, then he ought trust his god enough to not get upset about it.*

*Albert Mohler might find our existence embarrassing. But we call it reality. Our eyes have been opened to the evidence, and now we move forward together in the real world. The Clergy Project‚Äôs concern is not to take down the church, as Mohler suggests. It‚Äôs not to expose anyone‚Äôs secrets or make them look pathetic. This seems to happen just fine on its own. Neither does TCP‚Äôs concern intersect with Moher‚Äôs opinion, which is why five years later there‚Äôs not been a response. The Clergy Project‚Äôs concern is not dictated by the judgments of believers. No, The Clergy Project‚Äôs concern is providing support, community, and hope to religious professionals who have come to grips with reality and are moving forward to navigate accordingly.*

*It‚Äôs that simple. Whether Mohler likes it or not.*"

"I agree with this as someone completely against BU. It's an understated point that there are efficiencies that could be had in the block size as well. I don't think they should be entirely market base because it may lead to centralization (increasing too quickly). Also I think keeping the blocksize artificially low pushes optimization innovation which is much more exciting than a blocksize increase. Lightning for example is awesome because of its promise of low fees and instantaneous confirmations. No matter what, if you increase the block size to infinity, the conf time is still 10 min and for that reason can never be an ideal payment channel (can never compete with legacy payment companies).

I think once the code is optimized and third layer solutions emerge, I could support a steady slow block size increase to find the optimal size between between block and fee size."

"&gt; They already have fewer because of better education and means to control pregnancy. They don't need the state to subsidize birth control... they're doing that all on their own.

Yes. If you wanted them to have more children again. Tearing apart the nanny state and restoring religiosity would, I wager, do the trick.

&gt;What I propose is to disincentivize and help limit the much higher birth rates among the poor, who have been shown to have weaker family structures in the US,

So you want the American government. To create programs that deliberately lowers the birth rates of it minorities?

I'm genna have to take a strong stance against that.

"I've known for a while that the Republicans plan as preached was scary. Where healthcare is concerned I can't see private insurance working well, simply because the bottom line will come before healthcare. 

I had the honor over a decade ago of hearing about how a healthcare company jack up a family rate on people going through cancer (the child was) repeatedly. They kept claiming it was age based but even the court didn't fall for it (anyone shocked they'd sue?)

Healthcare needs regulations to keep it from killing sick people to keep the profit. It's one thing I think ACA got right, and while it may not be welcome here: I'm not opposed to a government run healthcare....If done right. Sanders plan was to much for me.

"There's a strong implication here that pharmaceutical prices are the primary contributor to high health care costs, and that simply isn't true. Pharmaceutical spending accounts for about 10% of health care spending. You could cut drug prices in half, and it would cut health care spending by 5%. Even if we could get them for free, the US would still spend a significantly greater percentage of GDP in health care than any other country.

"Somewhat relevant: 

Someone in u/skincareaddiction wanted to make a spreadsheet to find common ingredients in products that weren't working, so I made a tutorial on one method (using excel to find duplicate values). However, it doesn't color code different ingredients (might be possible though). https://youtu.be/53zUOh5ms-g


Notes:

-The ingredient combinations are completely made up products lol--although I'm sure this is obvious.

-After you have delimited the cell, make sure you add a space before the first word. When excel enters each word that follows a comma, into its own cell, it enters anything that follows the comma--which happens to be a space. So you want the first word to have a space in front of it so that it is recognized as a duplicate value."

"That's pure projection. You have no way of telling what my motivations or thoughts are on my performing, or not performing selfless acts. You're implying that you have yourself have performed such acts, therein assuming (at least in your perception) the moral high ground, thereby achieving a selfish (not saying that in the conventional negative sense, say, self-interested) satisfaction.

Consider the adage ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.""

Sublimation aside, my point is that a person doing the right thing can, consciously or unconsciously, derive some satisfaction or reinforcement from it. Self-sacrifice at a high level, that may result in harm to, or death of the individual is still encouraged or rewarded by some sort of feeling of satisfaction, or correctness, or nobility, or whatever you want to call it.

You're *assuming* that I'm saying this is a negative, that people are bad, or some such.

I'm just saying that humans and animals are essentially motivated by two things: positive and negative reinforcement, and our actions are more or less governed by these. It's neither good nor bad, just how it is.

I'm still unsure of the undertone but I'll wait and see what 204 (light-medium, yellow) tinted moisturizer will give me. What I really loved about the tinted moisturizer though was how it didn't cling at all to my dry area (near the corner of my mouth along my chin).

"I'm not a conservative but I do know what traditionalism is and why you support it. The question at hand though, as I see it, is not so much why traditionalism is good, but rather why it should be applied in this instance. You can advocate for traditionalist values without forcing them upon people, which seems to be what you want to do here. As such, you must justify why by showing how allowing for the ""degeneracy"" of a tiny portion of the population, whose cause for being ""degenerate"" was purely medical (gender dysphoria), will cause the rest of society to follow suit. If no such shift was to occur, I really don't see how you would be protecting traditional values by advocating against it. "

Hence why I said ""for a year"". As trump has demonstrated, not only can democracy pick the worst man for the job, actually getting rid isn't an easy task either.

"Two things there.  First, Musk might not be the one making the minute decisions, but if you look at other large companies, cough Apple cough, the CEO is still directly responsible for what happens.  Elon can be compared to Steve Jobs in they both have drive and vision.

However, Jobs shows us that things aren't perfect.  His over riding personality did prevent a few good ideas from surfacing.  Plus both of them are/were extremely driven and expect their employees to be equally driven.  That causes problems with work life balance, and is extremely stressful.

Having said that, Tesla and SpaceX are based around Elon Musk.  He makes no bones about how much he's sunk into both companies, and his tenacity is what keeps them improving at this rapid rate."

"It feels like it's become acceptable in our society to castigate right-wing voters, the same as it is with smokers, or the obese. (I'm not justifying that any of these people are acceptable targets myself, but it seems that our society has regrettably deemed it so) 

I simply advocate low-taxes to encourage hard work and entrepreneurial spirit. I also personally desire having a smaller government. One of my biggest issues with socialism and any left-wing policies is that it inevitably results in huge government institutions that have no competition, resulting in a poorer choice for the general public and less opportunity and transparency for the public.

I don't trust the government an inch. Hence why I seek to minimise their involvement with my life as much as possible. I've always thought of left-wing policies as inherently opposed to freedom. The idea of a huge hulking bureaucracy controlling every aspect of a countries economy is anathema to me.

Evidently I am in a small minority here and most people disagree with me, seeing as I've been down voted into oblivion. But there's nothing wrong with that, I'm content with my own opinions and choices, and I respect other peoples as well. This is why we vote. :)"

I personally would like to see some bigger blocks as well, but couldn't see why would anyone block Segwit, from the technical standpoint. Things just don't add up. Now we know why."

"&gt;However, I have noticed that posting links here to threads on a certain Bitcoin forum causes the post to get removed. Is there any specific reason for this? Were people spamming these links?

There's been a ton of rbtc spam since Roger acquired the sub. Sometimes it's in protest of /r/Bitcoin moderation, and other times it's just promoting the same rbtc lies. Lately they've resorted to PM spamming random commenters like the Ethereum pumpers used to do.

I'm noticing more posts in /r/Bitcoin calling rbtc out on their nonsense and that's excellent, but I'm not convinced that direct crossposting is the right way to go about it for two reasons.

* Crossposting to an 'antithetical' subreddit for anything other than observation (i.e. for commenting, voting) often results in brigading. We know very well how badly relatively small factions such as rButtcoin and rbtc can disrupt threads of a larger sub since it has happened here hundreds of times. Crosspost brigades act like magnifying glasses, placing a single thread/comment/individual under extremely one-sided scrutiny from an incoming raid. For this reason, I think /r/Bitcoin should **avoid** crossposting to rbtc directly, and instead use archive.is/.org links or screenshots. If they want to have craziness contests, let them. 

* rbtc has a lot of desperate attention seekers that thrive on negativity. Their goal is often to drag people down to their level and waste their time. *""Don't roll around with pigs. You'll just get dirty and the pigs will enjoy it.""* I don't expect rbtc will evaporate any time soon considering their multimillion dollar war chest, but I don't think they should be given any air either. 

That's not to say there aren't good people over in rbtc. Quite a few people got sucked into their misinfo stream. We've got our share of miscreants here too, and I'm sure rbtc has some actual knowledgeable people over there who actually hold reasonable and logical opinions. They're just drowned out by the craziness and confusion. That said, anyone who's opposing Segwit (on-chain scaling, fee relief, Layer 2) because of nasty subreddit politics is not thinking rationally. "

"I can't understand why though, even with hard fork ""risks"" he is not thinking logically. People have said for a long time this is a binary outcome, either bitcoin is worth everything or it is worth nothing. Eventually people will stop using bitcoin because they can't get their transactions in blocks cheaply or fast enough, they will move to something else. At the moment that something else is ethereum/monero/dash. Once any of them take over bitcoin it's pretty much game over. Bitcoin will stagnate start decreasing in market value, people will say buy the dip buy the dip, but the price will just keep going down, miners will begin to exit until bitcoin is back at a hashrate/price of pre 2013 at which point it will be abandoned completely. This might take a few years but it's probably the most likely outcome looking at today's environment. Core will get their ""decentralized currency"" but no one will be using it because there are more effective digital currencies out there.

Now here is the real problem, if bitcoin fails like this no one will trust digital currencies for a long time because in a few years it could be worth nothing. The first/most valuable/most stable/biggest ecosystem was reduced to nothing over a period of 5 years. What's to say the same won't happen to its successor, it's far too expensive/risky to rebuild your financial infrastructure every few years. So why not just wait a few decades until we know what's really going on and which one stands the real test of time."

"&gt; Could you provide this quote please? Because there is absolutely nothing like that out there:

I should have not used the word promised, I should have said ""suggested"" or ""clearly implied.""

In the NYT story, the intelligence officals said, ""[Flynn] urged Mr. Kislyak to keep the Russian government from retaliating over the coming sanctions....by telling him that whatever the Obama administration did could be undone.""

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/us/flynn-is-said-to-have-talked-to-russians-about-sanctions-before-trump-took-office.html?_r=0

That is a far cry from ""nothing like that out there.""  Flynn saying ""Don't retaliate...remember, Trump can undo whatever Obama did"" sounds an awful lot like an implied promise to lift sanctions if Russia does not retaliate.

The Transcript is not publicly available -- but the intelligence official in the NPR story you linked also said ""Flynn talked about sanctions, but no specific promises were made. Flynn was speaking more in general 'maybe we'll take a look at this going forward' terms.""

So again -- an indication of Flynn implying Trump would lift sanctions."

"Hi!

Serums will be your treatment piece! A vitamin C/antioxidant serum during the day
--eg Ole Henriksen, the truth serum; Drunk Elephant, C-Firma; Perricone MD, PRE:EMPT serum

And a low grade retinoid for evening
-- eg REN, bio retinoid oil; Sunday Riley, Luna; Skin Laundry, wrinkle release

You may want to start every other day with the retinol for a week and then increase to daily use. Another thing besides antioxidant serums and retinol to think about would be incorporating a weekly glycolic peel (e.g. Murad, or Drunk Elephant's baby facial), and possibly exploring supplements (HUM has a great variety, their OMG! omega supplements are a great place to start if you're new to supplements)

Blocksize isn't the only thing that's held back if miners won't upgrade their version of the Bitcoin software. No new features can be rolled out. But that's always been the case, miners are notoriously slow to upgrade.

But difficulty keeps increasing, and people come and go. The mining community looks different from one year ago, and very different from two years ago. Even if a large provider of mining equipment has some sort of political stance of only running a heavily patched two year old version of Bitcoin today, that is not likely to be the case next year."

"Not knowing the app or the problem it solves this will be kind of broad.

Chaplinsky vs New Hampshire demonstrated set the precedent that words designed to incite hate and harm are prosecutable under law.

Even though the charges were later dropped the case defined words that are both intended and likely to cause harm as not protected by the Freedom of Speech. 

In this case the 'scientist' behind the original paper both knew that his infomation was false (intent to cause harm) and by publishing created a situation where people are more likely to put them at risk. 

There is definitely a case against him but the law also requires a personal attatchment IIRC (little fuzzy on the last part).

Having a ""Bitcoin accepted here"" sticker at your physical store, or having such a logo on the checkout page of your online shop, might be like having a big neon sign above your head saying ""Please audit me, I don't have a VC exchange license"".

I think /u/Godfreee is one of the founders of Satoshi Citadel Industries, I'd like to hear their point of view regarding this.

---

Also, I've been looking at this part:

&gt; A VC exchange shall pay the registration and annual service fees as provided under Subsec. 4511N.8.

I looked it up and found [this](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1791148.msg17860463#msg17860463):

&gt; Like New York‚Äôs BitLicense, Bitcoin exchanges and **service providers** will have to pay a registration fee and annual fee of $2,000. That is an initial fee of $2,000 and a recurring annual fee of another $2,000. 

So apparently, any **service provider** who wants to deal in bitcoin will have to pay an annual fee of $2000, or P100,000 (!).

""Service provider"" is quite vague, and I interpret this to mean any business that would accept bitcoin as payment for their services. Also, the $2000 annual fee is quite prohibitive for many small-to-medium sized businesses, and they might just choose not to accept bitcoin altogether.

We can already see what the effect of this was in New York with their BitLicense. Lots of bitcoin businesses, both large and small, either left New York, or stopped accepting customers from New York.

IMO this is a bad way to start it off.  
Accepting fiat has no such fees, AFAIK neither does accepting credit.  
Why treat VC's differently?"
"Actually, it was pretty easy for them to rationalize it.  I saw dozens of Christian friends make comments like ""He's just a baby Christian.  He only recently was born again.""  Which, then allowed them to discount just about everything.  Past behavior?  Doesn't matter, because he's a better person now.  Current bad behavior?  You can't expect him to be perfect right out of the bat.  Everyone falls back on past behavior patterns after first being born again.

It was the perfect ""get out of jail free"" card for these people.  It erased all his past bad behavior and excused any current bad behavior.  It was sickening."

You are talking about following inputs and outputs as they are spent from address to address. I am talking about the **Bitfinex attacker's addresses**. Since the coins have moved more than one hop away we cannot know for sure who is in control of them now. In fact for all we know the hacker simply sold the private keys or even gave them away.  

There's nothing wrong with you tracking coins on the blockchain and it's interesting that some of the coins have now congregated back to a single address, however as I said already I was addressing the point made in the title of the post which suggested that $130,000,000 worth of Bitcoin might hit exchanges when in fact no *new* withdrawals have been made from the hacker's 2,072 addresses."

Making Sure that Lumber Measures Up

Posted Today
For some, it is a shocking revelation. But most Americans eventually come to accept the fact that a ‚Äútwo by four‚Äù board is actually 1.5 inches by 3.5 inches (38 x 89 mm). But is it really? How accurate are the dimensions of boards found at hardware stores and lumber yards? It‚Äôs the job of state and local inspectors to answer that question by making measurements periodically at retail locations, or earlier in the supply chain

who would actually be 'shocked' at this relelation? I really love the inclusion of the phrase ""most americans"" "

"Yeah I was more trying to discuss with my Dad if there was a chance a very small amount of insulin could still be produced by the body and if you severly limited sugars if it would be enough to run the things like you say (mainly the brain). And also if you had enough produced to get sugar to the brain even if there wasn't enough to keep your blood sugar from slowly continuing to rise would the kidneys be able to rid your body of the excess sugar build up over time.

We were just spitballing. And now I see this study which shows even a type 1 pancreas can work again so I just was kinda wondering if that also supported the idea we were talking about that a type 1 pancreas may still work a little bit but not enough to make even a bit of difference in a sugar heavy diet. 

Not pretending I know how the whole thing works we were just talking scenarios there and maybe just wondering if type 1 (or some type 1 people) still produced a small amount of insulin on their own. And now this study seems to show it is indeed possible in some scenarios."

"Yeah...your comment just resulted in me doing over an hour of digging into mass shooting/killing research. It was really enlightening, so thank you.

That being said, I think both of you sort of right and wrong at the same time. If you go through and read the profiles for the top mass shooters/murderers, the only truly defining characteristic that runs consistently through almost every instance, is that the perpetrators were socially withdrawn and/or mentally ill. Sometimes they're former military or conservatives and sometimes they're Muslim, but demographically, those 2 categorizations pale largely in comparison to mental illness and social awkardness/withdrawal. 

Also, if you look at overall violence, (especially related to guns which make up a majority of crime in the US),  it's interesting to note that there's no typically politicized categorizations that can occur there as well since Texas takes the top (extremely liberal/open gun laws) followed closely by California (arguably the most conservative/restrictive state when it comes to gun laws). In fact, if you look at all 50 states in the context of violence/shooting per capita, the only statistical consistency that arises is that high violence areas are greatest in states with high population densities/large metropolitan cities (New York, Florida, California, Texas, etc. Even Washington edges in there as well.). 

Tl;dr, from what I can tell by looking at overall data, all of the politicized categories that people typically ascribe to violence in the US is inconsistent (religion, race, gun laws, etc); and the only consistency that runs throughout instances of mass and overall violence is 1) mental illness and social withdrawal and 2) high population density areas (imagine that, you cram a ton of people into a small area and they get annoyed).

"&gt; Would they simply walk into the bank and say they want to renew the mortgage for 480k now and simply take 100k in cash and keep paying down the 380k?

Well, they'd walk into a bank and say they want to refinance. Its not a renewal because a key term (the amount borrowed) is changing. 

The house would need to be worth at least $576k before a bank would even think about this (20% equity), the person would need an income high enough to service a $480k mortgage and they'd probably want to know what the $100k was for and possibly even guarantees that other debt would be paid off. 

&gt; would be an optimal solution since the mortgage rate would be 2.4% or something vs 5-20%.

Maybe. Its not as simple as interest rate alone. A 5% loan paid off over 5 years will have a LOT less interest paid overall than a loan for the same amount at 2.5% but over 25 or 30 years. The magic of compounding is a double edged sword."

My issue is... Where is the original post, if mine is a repost?

Mod:

&gt; over discussion

Me:

&gt; There are several other posts at the top of the subreddit on this topic, and this is a link. This is a major story, full of information. What is the real reason?

Mod:

&gt; which part of over discussion do you not understand - the fact that you say that there are several submission on that subject at the top of our page makes my point - you are either trolling me or extremely obtuse

Me:

I commented [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/5w5z3q/if_ellison_loses_dont_abandon_the_dnc_bottom_up/de7z8rd/?context=3) to say

 &gt; Not if the moderation of this subreddit continues to stifle political engagement.

 but that was **removed**, under the ""novelty account/spam/troll"" rule by same mod.

* OP replied to me with

 &gt; I don't really know anything about the moderation of this subreddit, to be honest. I won't be surprised if I get suspended for raising too much hell at some point.

* I responded:

 &gt; I posted an [**article from The Intercept**](https://np.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/comments/5w71ug/keith_ellison_loses_dnc_race_after_heated/) that was published _today_ about events transpiring _today_. 

 &gt;The article contains

 &gt;* well-sourced facts, with copious hyperlinks

 &gt;* useful analysis of the general political situation

 &gt;* thoughtful explanation of multiple perspectives

 &gt;* discussion not prevalent in the consolidated news media

 &gt;And yet, it was removed under rule 5 (no reposts)--despite its **not** being a repost--with the alternative reason, ""over discussion.""

 &gt;Unbelievable.

Also **removed**. After that--with no warning at all--I was **banned** from participation and **muted** to their mod mail.

I don't blame religion or science but the people of that time. Without religion my people wouldn't have hope or comfort. 

&gt;Following religion to the T, logically, is the only reason you are truly following a religion. You can't be given a set of rules and just do half of them and be fine with it. If God is real and he says you cannot sleep with another man, and you do, but you follow everything else in the Bible and go to church every Sunday, do you think you would still go to heaven?
Do you see how ridiculous this is?

People are not perfect. You have a recipe doesn't mean you follow it to a T. That's not why people follow religion. You become Atheist so you don't have no rules, No. Because it's by choice and you feel your ideas are right. I'm not concern with Heaven. I'm concern about the people that come in my life. The people who need my help. I care about treating other I want to be treated. I use the Bible as a guide. How Jesus would do things. How societies changed over time. How God's people continue to disobey him or have up hope at times. It's not about following the Bible to a T, it's about living and doing good things for a neighbor, a friend, a Redditor. "

More mass translates to more gravity. The density does not have a direct impact. However with higher density it is possible to get closer to the object and the closer you are the more gravity there is. So if there is a star system and the star goes supernova and creates a black hole the planets (assuming they are unaffected by the supernova) would orbit the black hole in just the same way as before. There will be no changes in gravity. However it is now possible to get closer to the black hole then to the star since the black hole is smaller. So an incoming comet that might have crashed into the surface of the star before would now be able to get much closer to the black hole and therefore experience more gravitational pull.

"Look no further than the suburbs to see how American ideals of success are transforming.

People in US suburbs are changing the way they shop, where they eat, and what they want in their homes.

Malls are shutting down as e-commerce continues to take over, and the casual-dining chains that fed shoppers after a day of hoofing it through the mall are struggling to cope.

Business Insider reporters from the consumer, transportation, news, graphics, video, and innovation teams have explored this idea in a series of stories.

We're calling it the Death of Suburbia ‚Äî because if the trends that they identified continue, the suburbs as we know them could be forever changed.

The line is blurring between city and suburb
Urban and suburban areas are becoming less distinguishable as modern populations value convenience and location over size.

The line between city and suburb has already started to blur, Fadi Masoud, an urban-planning professor at the University of Toronto who contributed to a forthcoming book called ""Infinite Suburbia,"" told Business Insider's Leanna Garfield.

""Some people still attribute the oldest part of the city, which is predominantly pedestrian-friendly and more dense, as 'urban,' and then everything else that starts going out further in distance from the core as 'suburban.' But that definition doesn't work as well now,"" he told Business Insider. ""What you would usually define as urban and suburban is eroding.""

Urban planners across America are rethinking how suburbs are designed. Towns like New Rochelle, a suburb of New York City, are evolving to focus less on space and possession and more on walkability and environmental impact.

McMansions are out
The cheaply constructed mansions of old are plummeting in value as homebuyers are more discerning.

In an article in August 2016, Bloomberg cited data from the real-estate site Trulia that showed that the premiums paid for McMansions have declined significantly in 85 of the country's 100 biggest cities.

For the study, Trulia defined a McMansion as a home that was built between 2001 and 2007 and that had between 3,000 and 5,000 square feet of space.

In one example, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the extra money that buyers were expected to be willing to pay to own a McMansion fell by 84% from 2012 to 2016. In that same city in 2012, a typical McMansion would be valued at $477,000, about 274% more than the area's other homes. Today, a McMansion would be valued at $611,000, or 190% above the rest of the market.

Experts told Business Insider's Madeline Stone that the youngest generations of homebuyers tend to value efficiency more than ever before and feel that McMansions are impractical and wasteful.

Suburban malls are in crisis
As anchor-store behemoths like Macy's, Sears, and JCPenney close hundreds of locations, the future of malls is in jeopardy.

The commercial real-estate firm CoStar estimates that nearly a quarter of malls in the US, or roughly 310 of the nation's 1,300 shopping malls, are at high risk of losing an anchor store.

Once that happens, it spells trouble for communities ‚Äî especially those in the suburbs, where job opportunities are more limited than in cities.

""Malls are big, big contributors to city and state taxes, jobs, and everything,"" Howard Davidowitz, chairman of the research firm Davidowitz &amp; Associates, told Business Insider's Hayley Peterson. ""Once they close, they are a blight on the community for a very long time.""

As a transformation in retail continues to shutter giants like Sears and Macy's and threaten malls across the country, food-court mainstays like Sbarro, Cinnabon, Jamba Juice, and Panda Express face an uncertain future.

Companies are packing up and heading to the city
""In the past several years, a handful of America's largest corporations have joined a mass exodus from their suburban headquarters to new home bases in the city, and millennials seem to be the driving force,"" wrote Business Insider's Chris Weller.

Beginning in 2015, McDonald's, Kraft Heinz, and ConAgra Foods have all left the leafy suburbs of Chicago for office spaces downtown.

In August, General Electric announced it was ditching Fairfield, Connecticut, for Boston. And several years ago, the Swiss banking giant UBS returned to New York City after 15 years in Stamford, Connecticut. The reason? UBS realized much of its top talent lived or wanted to live 35 miles south, in Manhattan.

The roads that connect suburbs to city are falling apart
The roads and bridges that connect America's suburbs are in desperation need of repair.

The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the US a D grade for its roads and a C-plus grade for its bridges. The US Department of Transportation estimates that almost $1 trillion is needed to improve the current interstate and highway system in the US.

""In suburbs, the big challenge is repairing the existing highway system,"" Christopher Leinberger, chair of the center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis at George Washington University, told Business Insider. ""Ideally, there won't be any new highway capacity built because we can't afford to maintain what we have.""

Golf courses are shutting down
Playing golf was once a celebrated pastime. But today, many of the country's golf courses are on the brink of shutting down or have already closed.

Over 800 golf courses have shuttered across the US in the past decade, and data from the Sports &amp; Fitness Industry Association has shown that millennials between the ages of 18 and 30 lack interest in playing the game.

Casual dining is in crisis
For many years, suburban residents sought the treat of going to casual-dining chains.

But as more people choose to make their food at home, the restaurant industry is in crisis.

The weakest link in the industry was casual dining, which was the bottom performer in all but two months of the year. Most of these restaurants are in the suburbs.

Ruby Tuesday is in search of a new CEO and in the process of selling 95 restaurants amid falling sales. Bloomin' Brands, the parent company of casual-dining chains including Outback Steakhouse and Carrabba's Grill, announced plans in February to close 43 locations after a challenging 2016. Buffalo Wild Wings, where same-store sales fell 2.4% in 2016, is engaged in a power struggle with the activist investor Marcato Capital.

Shitty news is NOT fake news. Fake news is what you get when some random guy in SEA or Eastern Europe is just making up clickbait like ""pope endorses Trump"". Bad news is when a news outlet starts a rumor with their morning talk show or pundit guy then reports that there a lot of people outraged about the thing they just started earlier in the day on the nightly news. Fox is probably the most frequent offender on that particular example but they're definitely not the only one. Bad news is a journalist running a story they sourced from another article without being able to confirm it themselves because they want to get in before all the other channels.

"So I don't have 10, because I'd rather list a few quality choices over quantity, but here goes:

1. The Lean Start-up: consider this a blueprint for creating and building start-ups the right way. No one has documented best practices for start-ups, they just assume it's the same as an established business. Obviously, it's not. Killer advice that can save you months and endless capital.

2. Rework: this book is incredible and creatively formatted with pictures etc. It's basically a 200 page book full of sage advice, going against most common practices today. Really gives you clarity toward good business ideas (scratching your own itch) and how to do what matters, hire right, and go at the best pace, not the fastest pace. Don't have enough words to explain all the helpfulness.

3. Zero to One: this book was written by billionaire Peter Thiel, basically summarizing the start-up class he taught at Stanford Business School. It's especially helpful for people that are set on discovering ideas for a new business. Biggest piece of advice was something like... Stay at the edge of technology (in the future), and then build something cool. The book explains it much further, but it helped me focus on ideas that matter.

4. (had to edit this in but it's gold) How to Get Rich by Felix Dennis: if you're about making money in any way possible as fast as possible, this is your guy. He was up there with Richard Branson as one of the richest people in Great Britain, and set out to write a no-bullshit guide to the making of money, and why you should (or shouldn't!) do it. Priceless advice I can't find anywhere else. His book is on PDF format online as well.

Honestly, I could maybe list a few more but success isn't about the amount of books I read. I've valued much more from studying those in my field that pursued a worthwhile business and how they overcame their obstacles. Just getting my head in the right place. Then take action, or it's all for naught. "

"&gt; You are quite naive though to think religion all came from people who just got together, excited to believe. 

That's exactly what happened. All mainstream religions evolved over generations and have roots in more primitive oral traditions that go back thousands of years. At no point did someone sit down and design it for maximum control. Kings and princes grew up with the same beliefs and traditions that peasants did. They drank the same kool-aid, and no doubt liked that they were in a privileged position - but that's not the same as saying that they created religion for control. That's just dumb.

&gt;[Our review found no consistent pattern of positive associations indicating a causal relationship between total cancer (in adults or children) or any site-specific cancer and exposure to glyphosate.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22683395)

&gt;[After almost forty years of commercial use, and multiple regulatory approvals including toxicology evaluations, literature reviews, and numerous human health risk assessments, the clear and consistent conclusions are that glyphosate is of low toxicological concern, and no concerns exist with respect to glyphosate use and cancer in humans.](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/10408444.2014.1003423)

The public hears that BLM got TPS banned from the parade. The public hears that TPS and Toronto funds the parade directly and indirectly. The public believes that Toronto should cut funding because Pride and BLM are not being inclusive.

It's what the public percepts, and not what is right or wrong. 

If the public percepts it, that's what the public goes with, and so far, the public, is against BLM, and Pride, for excluding the Police. 

The public is also making references to other BLM requests from the past, which Pride now appears to be apart of, because they supported BLM in banning the Police from the parade. 

Public perception of an issue is more important and dangerous than the issue itself. We wouldn't be here if Pride had stood up to the (word we can't use here because it is disrespectful) that are BLM, and said no. "

"Those people were never going to change their view anyway. The evidence is clear, and widely available.

"The referendum wasn't about membership of the single market, it was about membership of the EU. You should have recognised that freedom of movement doesn't necessarily end when we leave the EU. There's absolutely no democratic mandate to leave the single market.

And what do you mean it's about sovereignty of the people? How does leaving the EU give the people more power over the country other than allowing us to continue voting in MPs to Parliament who'll now just have slightly more control over the UK governance than inside the EU.

Recent survey results also showed that the Lib Dems are the most popular party amongst users of this sub as well, so I don't know what you're talking about. If it upsets that people are challenging your views then you shouldn't even be interested in politics."

"&gt; When the first reaction of half the comments here isn't about the men's issues which are being raised but instead ""why does this committee have the word women in it rararaaaaa"" ... then you begin to realise that people just don't give a shit about the issues and that changing a stupid name isn't going to appease them.

I can understand that in theory. But those were comments prompted by your baiting, come on. Look at yourself when having a go at other people, if only as a second guess.

The *top* comment is not only dealing with the actual subject, but lampooning the kind of people you're criticising, the ""me-too"" MRAs who just want to have a go at feminists rather than engage in actual dialogue for equality. The next one down says exactly what you're complaining about here. The third raises the issue of names, you're right, but you're leaping to conclusions if you think it's just someone who hates feminism, rather than someone who wants to engage in the discussion I'm talking about. And even then, you have replies acting as a counterpoint to theirs and essentially arguing what you're saying.

The rest are only a response to your baiting, like I said. Which you posted before anyone else commented, not even giving the thread a chance before writing it off. The dismal response you're claiming objectively isn't reflected in what's going on here, yet to hold tight to it anyway. Frankly I think you're finding problems not just because you're looking for them, but because you're actively prompting them.

&gt;then you begin to realise that people just don't give a shit about the issues and that changing a stupid name isn't going to appease them.

Again, reaching an unscientific conclusion based on an emotional position. I'm trying to have this discussion sympathetically, but frankly this is boiling down to little more than hypocrisy. And yes, frustration (very understandable frustration) makes it sorely tempting to give up, and even breeds hypocrisy. Happens to the best of people. Doesn't make it OK, or an actual argument against what I'm saying.

&gt;When feminism is required to always adjust its ""presentation"" or it's the problem, whereas anti-feminists can champion people who can say the most outrageous shit and their ""presentation"" doesn't seem to matter ... then it becomes a double standard that it's very difficult to care about.

So we should ignore any discussions about making the feminism debate more productive until all anti-feminists disappear? And you don't think that's a slightly ridiculous position? It does matter, you're not the only one criticising them, and using them as an excuse is irrational. Get on with the important stuff, just like you said. Part of which is trying to address misunderstandings in a way which benefits everyone, and furthers the movement as a whole.

Again, you're being just as unreasonable as the people you're complaining about now. I don't really care how annoying it is, if you expect better of other people then practice it yourself. People are criticising anti-feminists right at the top of the this thread, yet you're ignoring it in favour of your hopeless rendition of the situation.

You're doing the exact same thing as these anti-feminists, thinking what you want to think in spite of evidence and ignoring your own involvement, as an excuse not to change your position. You can't seriously expect me or anyone else to have sympathy for that, any more than you have sympathy for these people you take time out to pre-emptively lampoon.

I think we've both spent enough time in the weeds on this (and I for one have put off enough work...), but I'll say the same to you as I'd say dyed in the wool anti-feminists you're laying in to. There is no double standard if you stop ignoring large parts of the equation, and stop looking for excuses to feel hard done by. Take a look in the mirror."

The reason we so often *feel* wronged is because we so often *are* wronged, often by members of religious communities who feel that our beliefs are a threat to theirs.  Our children are socially punished for our simple demand that schools follow the law;  Let's address that first since that's the topic at hand and when you want to talk about something different you can start a new thread about your feeling that religoius people are systematically persecuted in the same manner.

"That's a very strange counter-example for you to use because, well, you DID tell your parents.  Clearly even though you were in shock and struggling to process your emotions about the event, you also had enough trust in your parents to divulge that information even if it was challenging or embarrassing for you.  Now what if you believed your dad would beat the shit out of you for telling him your secret?  Would you have told them willingly (even if they had to drag it out)?  Would you appreciate a trusted authority figure telling them?

Parents are constantly trying to drag secrets out of their teens, and if there is a solid bond there they are often successful.  If the teen cares SO MUCH about keeping their sexuality or gender identity a secret from their parents and there isn't a sufficient bond for the parent to learn that info from the teen directly, then I don't see how the state compelling teachers to interfere is beneficial to the situation."

I don't know what  ads you're talking about -- since you didn't bother to link to any -- but my guess is that the ""entity"" that has it out for Uber is their competition, both conventional taxi services and other ride-sharing companies.

And why exactly is it bad for the competition to run ads against Uber Especially since a quick Google search shows that Uber has run ads against their competition? And why do you think it's Lyft vs the cab companies? And why should we specially ""support Uber"" just because their competition is attacking them? Per the name of this sub, that's _business_."

If said person is fighting for Daesh, such intelligence could be used to save innocent lives or locate enemy assets. If they're fighting for aligned forces, it allows a heads-up if there's shady shit going on like, say, Russian-manufactured weaponry in the background of an ill-advised selfie, or geographical locations supposedly in the hands of a different side of the conflict than the one your contact is fighting for.

"&gt;It‚Äôs a tale of two countries. For the 117 million US adults in the bottom half of the income distribution, growth has been non-existent for a generation, while at the top of the ladder it has been extraordinarily strong. And this stagnation of national income accruing at the bottom is not due to population ageing. Quite the contrary: for the bottom half of the working-age population (adults below 65), income has actually fallen. In the bottom half of the distribution, only the income of the elderly is rising.5 From 1980 to 2014, for example, none of the growth in per-adult national income went to the bottom 50%, while 32% went to the middle class (defined as adults between the median and the 90th percentile), 68% to the top 10%, and 36% to the top 1%. An economy that fails to deliver growth for half of its people for an entire generation is bound to generate discontent with the status quo and a rejection of establishment politics.

&gt;Because the pre-tax incomes of the bottom 50% stagnated while average national income per adult grew, the share of national income earned by the bottom 50% collapsed from 20% in 1980 to 12.5% in 2014. Over the same period, the share of incomes going to the top 1% surged from 10.7% in 1980 to 20.2% in 2014.6 As shown in Figure 2, these two income groups basically switched their income shares, with about 8 points of national income transferred from the bottom 50% to the top 1%. The gains made by the 1% would be large enough to fully compensate for the loss of the bottom 50%, a group 50 times larger.

&gt;To understand how unequal the US is today, consider the following fact. In 1980, adults in the top 1% earned on average 27 times more than bottom 50% of adults. Today they earn 81 times more. This ratio of 1 to 81 is similar to the gap between the average income in the US and the average income in the world‚Äôs poorest countries, among them the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and Burundi. Another alarming trend evident in this data is that the increase in income concentration at the top in the US over the past 15 years is due to a boom in capital income.**It looks like the working rich who drove the upsurge in income concentration in the 1980s and 1990s are either retiring to live off their capital income or passing their fortunes onto heirs.**"
"&gt; if they want to be the dominant fork of BTC, they need at least 50.00000000000000000...1%,

I think one would need ~55% hashing power to be 50% certain that the big-block-chain would survive after first attempt on a chain-split, due to random-walk and an asymmetry.

If a big block is mined, and half of the network does not recognize it as a valid block, the chain is split.  If the small-block-chain ever outgrows the big-block-chain (which is likely to happen during the first few blocks) the big-block-chain will be abandoned by everyone.  This is asymmetric as the smallblockers will never accept the bigblock-chain.

Since 50% probability isn't good enough and since most actors don't want a split causing two competing bitcoins to be around, there won't be any split without at least 75% of the mining power supports bigger blocks.

&gt; The long answer is that they could just as easily fork off right now,

No, with the current BU-logic, it's impossible to fork off a ""bigblock-network"" without having a hashing majority.  As soon as a BU miner observes that the smallblock-chain is longer, it will abandon the bigblock-chain.  There has been talks about modifying the software so that it's possible to do a minority-fork ... but this minority-fork wouldn't be bitcoin, it would be an altcoin, and since there are already hundreds of altcoins to choose between it doesn't make much sense to create yet another altcoin.
"
"The problem then is: the inertia of the regular market, the wider public to whom the word ""Bitcoin"" is not a philosophical thing but a tool that they use. That market is effectively the prime real estate, and will 90% of the time determine which fork wins out.

As it is now, by default they will go with whatever software continues to work for them, but simultaneously the existing Bitcoin software is not designed to gracefully handle the collapse in hashpower which would occur if there is a hashpower majority hard fork. For example if there was a 75% majority hard fork, the minority chain would have at most 1 quarter as many blocks being created, and 1 quarter as many transactions being confirmed as a result. This situation would last many weeks at least. Some believe that the minority branch could survive this, others believe it will die with certainty, but I think nobody would deny that it would not handle it gracefully unless there is *another* hard fork to rescue it.

Depending on your idea of Nakamoto consensus, a majority hard fork like that is either an attack on the participants in the network, or it is just how consensus was supposed to form on new rules. When there is a divide in the community, both sides believe that the inertia legitimately belongs to their side. In a minority-hashpower hard fork, participants* are not forced to make a decision, their blockchain will continue as is. Even a minority hard fork is illegitimate to many, but it may be less illegitimate because  participants will continue mostly undisrupted on their chain. In another view, the 'legitimate' outcome when there is a very significant split, where a (human) consensus has formed on a change with the hashpower to support it, is to force participants to choose. The failing nature of a minority chain ensures that in this scenario, they will be forced to make the choice. Although if the issue were anything other than block size, they might not be forced to make this choice, because block size in particular constrains transactions. A block every 40 minutes might be manageable if the network was operating at less than 1/4 capacity anyway.

"As humankind reaches out into the galaxy, we are bound to find other worlds which are Earth-like, but like Mars are not identical to Earth.  I wonder if Terra-forming is the best path to take.  Perhaps over time we can add to the Martian atmosphere to make that planet retain heat, increase the atmospheric pressure and add oxygen, but we cannot increase the gravity.  That depends entirely on mass.  Imagine that we find another world that has the right temperature and air pressure but its' gravity is 1/3 greater than Earth.  Perhaps another planet has enough oxygen but is quite cold.  The solution, it seems to me, is not to change the planet to fit humans but to change the humans to fit the planet.  
The new world has low oxygen content?  Genetically alter the human settlers to have greater lung capacity.  A planet with higher gravity would require people who are short and sturdy with greater muscle mass.  A warmer planet would need people who are tall, thin and dark like the Watusi people in Africa.  A compact body that retains heat, like the Eskimo or Innuit of the Artic is best for cold climate.  
In time this genetic alteration could lead to a fabulous variety of humanity scattered throughout the galaxy."

Biology is chemistry too. Biology adjusts the balance of the chemicals in the atmosphere. It adjusts the balance of in and out energy to some degree as well. 

It is an extra point of consideration. But it doesn't change thermodynamics and the equilibrium nature of the atmosphere. That's what a high-low pressure system is that gives us weather. Thinking of the atmosphere as a system seeking equilibrium is still perfectly relevant. What it seeks equilibrium with changes, and in part due to biology, but seek it still does. "

"It'll be interesting to see how manufacturers deal with this going forward. Someone like Google only offers 3 years worth of updates on their phones; Apple offers 5. 

I think that 5 or 6 years ago that made more sense because the difference between device generations much larger: a phone your bought in 2012 was significantly better than a phone from 2010. 

Now though? I think you'd be hard pressed to find a 2017 phone that differs significantly from a phone released in 2015, aside from maybe screen resolution (but even then, the original Nexus 6 had a 1440p screen). So people feel less inclined to upgrade their handsets, I think. 

As for TVs, that's an even bigger thing. At least Google and Apple can extend OS support for phones, but TVs that people hold onto much longer? I'm not sure what the solution is there. 

Not like TVs make lots of use of encryption anyway, so it's sort of tangential to the AP article. "

"My latest order was to go long on $AVAV, and actually I'm about 10% down from where I entered. I really like the looks of this company, and would recommend it now more than ever (since it's down a bit).

They make unmanned aircraft systems (UAS, aka drones), which are sold ""primarily to the US Dept of Defense"". Revenue was down the last few years since orders from the military were down. A couple things are happening that I like. #1 is I'm thinking with this new administration the orders for drones will be up. By the way most of the drones they make are for recon and surveillance, not for killing (if you have a moral quandary about that). #2 during these last few years they also started looking for new clients besides the military and have therefor branched out to commercial applications like farming, real estate, security on large properties etc. Their [Puma‚Ñ¢ AE](https://www.avinc.com/uas/view/puma) model got some early or ""first ever"" FAA approval for over-land use above a certain altitude.

Now here's the other interesting thing. AVAV also makes charging stations and equipment (plugs, cables, boxes) for electric vehicle charging. They're the ""preferred charging solution"" for 8 automakers, like the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt. This side of the business was about 4% of last year's revenue, if I recall correctly. Not much in any case. But I can only imagine it'll grow in the upcoming years."

"I suppose it's true looking at it from the perspective of a double standard when it comes to moral judgment. Like, personally, I don't agree with the government meddling in gay marriage, but I also don't agree with them meddling in any marriage period. But I do recognize it's more of a tax/legal issue than actually calling judgment on a moral stance from the government. 

As to my stance on sex, it's interesting that you include infertile people with those using contraception and same-sex. Of course, we don't *shame* someone who's infertile, but I think the majority of people would recognize it's a defect and it's something that people generally pity because they cannot have children.

And I suppose it's a little bit of both religious and evolutionary in my opinion. I think the moral aspect is religious, i.e. marriage is between a man and a woman. But I like to look at it from an evolutionary standpoint. Basically, every change made to humanity (and other animals) was to ensure our population continued growing. Those changes are made through the people with the most desirable traits (or, at the very least, the people who were still alive and were attractive in some way) procreating together. You cannot evolve as a species, or even grow as a species, without having sex. If the first Neanderthals were gay (or at the very least, if they were, if they acted on it), the human race would've been extinct before it started. So, I do think, to some extent, evolution does back up that being gay or infertile is something that should be pitied rather than celebrated. "

"I'm not going to spend thousands of dollars to transfer my setup to SSDs just to ""try it and see"".  You're going to have to provide an explanation for people to believe you, because I'm not seeing any.  

I'm not saying you're wrong, because I'm certainly not an expert, but I'm not a novice either.  

Reading 100 GB into memory from a hard disk would take about 10-15 minutes on a HDD; on a RAID it'd take significantly less (and I'm fairly certain most people doing serious deep learning will have a RAID or similar setup).  

By comparison, actual training time is on the order of hours, maybe even days for complex designs on the GPU.  Reading the data in could also be offloaded to another thread, so the training and reading of data could theoretically happen in parallel.  

So again, getting an SSD from my experience and understanding would provide almost no benefit, and that money would be far wiser spent getting better or more GPUs.  "

"I'm only asking because I'm curious- your statement comes across as a little harsh. Do you believe anyone who believes in a higher power has faith in something so outrageous? This debate has been around as long as humanity has been able to verbally communicate, and is not so easily dismissed

I've spoken to a psychologist that actually pushed me to delve more into my beliefs. It is proven that faith does not constitute mental illness. While I may have OCD, it's not like it formed from having faith, and I'm certainly *not trying to push my OCD on you here. I'm just hoping to clarify, and spread a little love and understanding. I would never dream of criticising someone's beliefs unless they went directly against science, but there are many scientists today that are inspired and motivated by their beliefs. I, personally, was motivated to start debunking Christian-Catholic's institutional claims, by using their own words against them. See my previous comment to this thread, but I believe it's totally possible that Jesus could have existed as a totally normal dude, and have a lot of fun reading and imagining what his life could have actually been like

I think it's important to challenge beliefs to further understanding, but nothing more. Again, I just could never imagine wanting to degrade someone's mental stability based on their having faith alone. Everyone's definition is different, and conversation is key to progression. If you don't offer someone the time of day to explain their beliefs, you're losing out on an opportunity to learn, or even possibly correct the other person "

"With a 9.7% deficit of GDP and growing Scotland's economy is already in too poor a state to meet the 3% limit to join the EU. Croatia right now is running a 3.2% deficit so is fairly on target, even with the bad effect of the recession the average was only 4.5% but most of that was before the 2012 'growth and stability pact' came into force anyway.

"&gt;You have no basic understanding of software development. 

You couldn't be more wrong, for sometime now I've been highlighting the total lack of system boundaries in the SegWit proposal, it's a play thing for protocol developers as amplified by Lombrozo and that's a big part of the problem. SegWit, it's not entirely a scaling solution despite attempts to marketed it as one, thus it's being rejected.

&gt;doesn't mean the devs are incompetent.  

SegWit! more than a year long in development, lacking clear boundaries more a bells and whistles plaything for devs than a scaling solution,  activation rejected and failed. Transaction fees at an all time high and UX at an all time low. Core developers are not incompetent ?

&gt;Do you understand that?

"&gt;The inability to assess credible risks through sheer lack of will is disturbing.

Define what you mean, don't just write platitudes and rhetoric.

&gt;So you are basically saying no viable risks can ever be foreseen and taken into account when determining policy? 

Economic policy - Sometimes, but not always, take the economic crash as an example.

Social policy - Depends on the party and their core values/beliefs/ideology. 

Criminal policy - Often not, because the independent judiciary get final say. Their final say is based on qualifiable and quantifiable evidence. 

&gt;Policies are almost entirely written on **projections of impacted outcome**. Hardly anything to sniffle at.

Projections of impacted outcome, you cannot have an ""impacted outcome"" from a projection, you have a perceived outcome, a possible outcome, never an impacted outcome. You can have an impact analysis which presents various possible outcomes based upon input data but that again is just a projection that can be flawed. 

Considering you are the person who is presenting the idea of future potential crimes, why not qualify this? Link evidence that points towards it.

You seem like you enjoy rhetoric but you have zero substance, you mix up terminology and try to sound like you know what you are talking about when ""impacted outcome"" exemplifies you simply don't.

That's desirable to Russia so Russia worked hard to help get him elected.

"As an example Norfolk does ok for itself, has a fair mix of wealthy and not so wealthy living along its coast, and its connections are pretty poor outside of Norwich.

The UK needs to invest in Thanet and towns around it, probably on the scale of docklands regeneration.

Fast/high speed rail links, new housing projects, take advantage of the coast and beaches and build facilities.  Create a big summer economy, somewhere folks form towns will want to head to when the sun is out.

It probably also needs a 'thing' like the Eden Project in Cornwall.  Give the area something to create employment and demand for accommodation etc.

I've seen the number 10% thrown around a few times for an idea because there are so many other important factors to consider in starting a business besides that.

As to whether you should invest $20k, I think that depends on your confidence in the venture. $20k to grow a wildly profitable business is very different than throwing it towards partially building a product who's viability in the market hasn't been tested yet. It could be overkill or underkill, depending on what you invest it in."

"Equality of outcome isn't possible. Women (and all other groups) already have equality of opportunity. 

But to my main point, the more equal two groups are, the more severe any remaining inequalities appear, regardless of their true severity.

For example, when women didn't have the right to vote they didn't complain about making ""77 cents on the dollar"" to men. Fast forward to today, men and women are equal in the US. So now they come up with new things to complain about. ""Manspreading"", ""mansplaining"", etc.

"I'd also argue that this is irrelevant to the original question about disparity. Things are unquestionably better for most people, but if you are outputting several times as much as you could twenty years ago and are being paid basically the same, that extra producitivty is effectively now being used by your boss to subsidize and even *greater* lifestyle for themself.

I think one trick a lot of anti-labor and anti-union folk pull (and not to accuse YOU of doing this specifically!) is looking at absolute personal achievement in terms of posessions and ignoring the growing disparity between themselves and the very wealthy. Also, homes and cars may be nicer but fewer people are able to afford them."

"&gt; The trouble with this argument (the Luddite Fallacy) is itself is based on a logical fallacy, that historical trends universally predict the future.

True, but we know that my statement is 99.9999 repeating percent correct, whereas the assertion that somehow further automation will suddenly have the opposite affect that it has ALWAYS had in all of recorded human history is not based on any form of evidence or empirical research, so it may by discarded until it has any factual support.

&gt;It also fails to answer the questions the discussion about Robots/AI capable of doing most jobs pose. How can free market economics survive as our predominant economic organizing principle?

The same way every other market survived after heavy automation. If you require an example look at farming and mathematics. 

&gt;Robots/AI will be able to do the future jobs that haven't been invented yet &amp; the bigger issue ( indeed the main pertinent issue) - humans won't be able to compete with them economically in a free market economy.

Of course not, that would be the same as a human with a spoon trying to dig an irrigation ditch faster than a 80k farm tractor. Why would you try to compete? Why wouldn't you learn how to operate and maintain the tractor rather than breaking your back digging?

&gt;Robots/AI - will work 24/7/365 for pennies an hour, will never need social security or health contributions &amp; will be on a Moore's Law trajectory of constantly doubling in power &amp; halving in cost.

See original argument for this one. Automation and efficiency does not reduce long term employment.

&gt;Any future business with human employees who tries to compete with a similar business with robots/AI employees is doomed to failure in a free market economy.

The same goes for any industry that has automated in the past. There has never been a reduction in QoL or jobs.

&gt;The Luddite Fallacy says nothing about this &amp; yet its the main pertinent issue.

It doesn't have to because 100 percent of observable evidence supports it and says you have nothing to worry about. If the rules of gravity suddenly stopped applying, we would rewrite the rules of what we know because we are wrong in our understanding, but you don't go assume the laws are not correct because you lack an understanding of gravity.

I feel that people who want trump to go down are being short-sighted. He is not that bad, in my opinion, and I don't feel like things have changed for me since Jan 20th. If he goes down, Pence will be in charge. I'm afraid of his crazy views on abortion and religion. Trump is quite liberal, heck he was a democrat not too long ago. I don't think he cares about gay marriage one way or the other. I don't think he is actually a racist. He knows his audience and actually lucked out in the end because Hillary was not the best candidate. 
I just feel that we should watch what we wish for. If you want Trump to go for whatever reason, well, then you are going to be stuck with something really scary.
So instead I say let's hope nothing crazy goes down, let the guy do his job and not tangle him in this Russia thing. He really did win fair and square. Hillary was a much more scandalous candidate and I don't want to even know what was happening with the Clinton Foundation. Trump is a rich guy who does real estate deals for rich people. There are rich people in Russia who need places to put their money, such as real estates. Thus the meetings and the connections. I was in south of france and spain a while back and entire mountainsides by the ocean is owned by russian and saudi billionaires. That's part of the lifestyle of the rich and famous, and Trump is part of that circle like any other rich guy.
I say let's hope for the best, and focus on making our days better. This negativity is going to eat away at people. I see this on Facebook and feel that some folks are losing a grasp on reality.
anyway, like i said, none of this aimed at you. i drank a bit and just decided to type out some thoughts. peace."

"&gt;And let's say Liberals and Conservatives work together on some.  Is that really why people will have voted the Conservatives in?  To work with the party they didn't vote for?  Or would they have voted them in only to represent them specifically?  You need to remember what ""people"" are and why they vote in the first place.  If a party works with an opposition party to get something through, that is going to make people who voted for one and not the other uneasy because maybe in the future they will work together again, it's a compromise when the people who voted them in would rather have an all or nothing, etc.


If a majority of the country doesnt share your views, what right do you have to pass legislation that the majority do not want? That is the question at hand. The 40% of the Cons votes, using numbers above, could be full Libertarians. If the other 30 and 30 is Socialists and Centrists, you are going to need votes to pass legislation and that requires compromise.


&gt;and now there is risk of ideology bleed between the two (Liberals/Conservative).  So your party would lose support and now using that Liberal/Conservative thing then next time NDP gets the majority vote.  And then that problem would continue until the majority vote creates a majority party that has such a significant lead that you end up with the problem we have now that people wanted electoral reform for.


What are you on? If the Liberals and Conservative have the same policies (ideology bleed) and voters reject that by voting NDP, a majority at that, then that means your polices were rejected by the larger group. Either alter your views or present them better. Majority wins. That's all that matters. How would parties keep swinging til one has an insurmountable lead? If that is the case, those policies are what the people have chosen. And that is that.


&gt;But if we are eliminating parties for not having enough votes how is that different from right now?  It would just be allowing more parties in but still telling some parties they aren't popular enough so scram.  I thought the point was to get as much representation as possible?  Even if it's just say 1%, that's a portion of the population that needs representation, isn't it?


The point is to get as much representation as possible. Key words: as possible. You can never have enough groups to satisfy and mirror every person's political views. That 1% just did not have enough national support for them to be a part of government. The restriction is put there so governments can function.


&gt;Which is creating a overwhelming majority in the House to force something through despite opposition, so again, how is this any different from today?


Except this overwhelming majority(a NDP/Liberal coalition comprising of 60% of the vote) is legitimate because an overwhelming majority of PEOPLE voted for them. Thats how its different. It isnt a false majority like the current government where a majority did not vote for them but they have all the control. Honestly, this is just absurd."
"I'm not saying it's not bad (though I'm neither American nor black, so this is all superficial observation), I'm sure it has a long way to go, or you wouldn't need a movement called Black Lives Matter. But there appears to be more widespread awareness among black people themselves (if not the general populace) about their own value and history that here in Brazil has only barely started. I'm gonna use something my husband points out as an example: when you see black basketball players, their wives are black. But black soccer players in Brazil all get white, blonde girlfriends. That's not bad in itself of course, it could be a mere preference, but it's so ubiquitous it comes across as internalized rejection."

"I have to endure the misery of wearing a bodycam at work, albeit in a policing context. 

What I will say from the off, as much as I despise the message they scream - ""I don't trust my employees"", is that it's resulted in me receiving ZERO complaints since I've had one.  Compare that to that one or two a month I got beforehand and clearly there's a selfish benefit.

Interestingly, I haven't changed a single thing I've done before and after.  I still casually swear in conversation where it won't upset people I'm with; I'm still candidly honest with people; I still do my job effectively.

I detest bodycams; I loathe the fact they're deemed necessary.  It infuriates me that I ""need"" one to ""prove"" I'm honest, despite all the vetting I've been through.  That said; it's clearly symptomatic of a society that has a large number of people prepared to lie and try to ""blag it"" when making complaints to try and get themselves out of the shit by discrediting the people addressing their poor behaviour. 

However...  We can't complain about these things; there are huge groups of people prepared to make bullshit allegations against public sector workers; there are equally large groups of people demanding ""accountability"" from these public sector workers.  These cameras simply prove that these workers are decent people doing the right thing.

Yes, it's an infringement of privacy.  Yes, it's not nice to be filmed.  We've brought it on ourselves as a society though and we've decreased productivity too as a consequence.  I spend 1/10 of my life downloading the bloody footage from it!

"Yeah, prepaid brings up a good point -

What happens if you sell your car? In-state, out-of-state? What if it gets totaled or stolen? Are you still paying for the miles since your last payment?

Not to mention that people are notoriously terrible at budgeting even simple shit like tires and brakes. What happens when someone drives 50k miles for work and then can't pay the bill? Fee structures, license suspensions, car impounding, arrest warrants for failure to pay, etc... lots of choices, most of which are problematic.

From a purely technical standpoint, something like singapore's solution is pretty obvious - they basically track everything - but there, driving a car is an expensive privilege; here, it's a de facto right (since any mouthbreather can get and keep a license and a car, as long as they're not too drunk too often.) Privacy is a huge issue with a tracker, or even with very heavy tolling (since that data is collected and kept for ages - or it can be, anyways).

From a technical point of view, I'd want a tax base for different weight classes, multiplied by miles, with mile-multipliers for driving through congestion (101 at 9am is 5x, for example.)

From a privacy point of view, I'd be okay with paying a use tax based on raw mileage every year or whatever.

Prepayment ... I'm not sure it would solve the real problems of people not having cash and driving anyways.

"It is, and if you look at the big picture you know why.  If this passes, insurance companies will fast track tests to determine if a person has or will have an expensive-to-treat disease.  

The most likely reason for your death is:

&gt; [1] Heart disease and cancer

&gt; [2]  Chronic lower respiratory disease

Now imagine the insurance companies can do this.  If you, or anyone in your family have the *chance* of being expensive to treat, you will either pay more for coverage or maybe denied outright.  What will they target?  Let's think about this for a second.  Done!

As of 2016, here are some of the [most expensive to treat conditions](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160628/NEWS/160629901):

(*parens are mine*)

&gt; 1 Septicemia (blood poisoning, especially that caused by bacteria or their toxins.)

&gt; 2 Osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease, AKA arthritus) 

&gt; 3 Liveborn (childbirth)

&gt; 5 Acute myocardial infarction (AKA a heart attack) 

&gt; 6 Congestive heart failure 

&gt; 7 Spondylosis (A general term for age-related wear and tear of the spinal disks), intervertebral disc disorders, other back problems 

&gt; 8 Pneumonia 

&gt; 9 Coronary atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)

&gt; 10 Acute cerebrovascular disease (when a blood vessel becomes blocked, usually from a clot formed from fat and cholesterol, and this can cause a stroke)

&gt; 11 Cardiac dysrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)

&gt; 12 Respiratory failure, insufficiency, arrest (adult) 

&gt; 13 Complications of surgical procedures or medical care 

&gt; 14 Rehabilitation care, fitting of prostheses, and adjustment of devices 

&gt; 15 Mood disorders 

&gt; 16 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis 

&gt; 17 Heart valve disorders 

&gt; 18 Diabetes mellitus 

&gt; 19 Fracture of neck of femur (hip) 

&gt; 20 Biliary tract disease (inflammation of the gallbladder) 

Is there anything on the list that you or an associate has, or may have?  If the insurance companies can develop a test to detect it ... well, I wish you al the best homepathic remedies on your journey.

On the other hand, if these people had any morals and ethics, they would spend the money on developing *cures* and *affordable treatments* to these conditions.

"The EPA was created in 1970, at a time when it was much easier to prevent publicity about illegal dumping.  An article about blatant corporate wrongdoing in the local paper was very unlikely to gain enough public awareness to hold the perpetrator accountable.

Nowadays information regarding issues of public concern is able to spread much more quickly and to a much wider audience.  News about illegal dumping can easily spread to environmentally concerned citizens across the nation, who then demand accountability.

In the digital age, citizens themselves are very capable of providing the initial oversight that has conventionally been the job of government inspectors.  We live in a world of unprecedented transparency whether companies like it or not.

"amps is a measure of capacity and volts is a measure of intensity.  think of it like your electricity service is a highway.  the faster the voltage, the higher the speed limit.  the more amps the more lanes.  

you are likelly to run into (by voltage) 120 single phase, then 120/208 3 phase then 277/480 3 phase.  single phase means one hot wire, 3 phase has 3 that are 1/3 out of phase.  the first number is the voltage per phase and the second is the combined voltage.  

3 phase is mostly used for motors and lighting.  some other non obvious things too, like coffee roasters and chocolate roasters.  

so how do you know what you need?  you ask the client.  when you ask them about location and sf you should be asking ""do yoy have any special power needs like 3 phase or heavy power (this is the common term for high amp).  

keep in mind you can add amps typically with a new service panel.  adding different voltages and 3 phase requires they be at the pole, which they might not be.  you can also use phase and voltage converters but these lose the efficiency you gain from 3 phase and are expensive so if someone uses a lot of power this isnt an attractive option.  if it is a matter of 1 3 phase machine they use, then sometimes this is an easy solution."

"&gt; As CS Lewis put it, ""Men became scientific because they expected Law in Nature, and they expected Law in Nature because they believed in a Legislator.""

Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Imagine that an early scientist was obsessed with oranges, and so he decided that the world must be round because oranges taste so good that the world must be shaped like one. His reason for expecting the world to be round was completely, ludicrously flawed, but it still led to something that happened to be true (for completely different reasons). The fact that science is an effective method for discovering true things about the world doesn't mean the premise of the initial reason why ""men became scientific"" is true.

&gt; As Scientific American wrote, ""‚Ä¶ even the biggest, fastest supercomputers in the world cannot match the overall processing power of the brain. And they are nowhere near as compact or energy efficient."" But we're supposed to believe that such power and efficiency was the result of random mutations and a blind force.""

Mutations over *billions* of years, don't forget that part. With the exponential rate that computer technology is improving, I expect that we'll have computers that can easily match the overall processing power of the human brain within fifty years or less. Imagine how insanely powerful and smart our computers would be if we had a billion years. They would be orders of magnitude better than what God allegedly came up with."

"I can't speak for other companies, but the company I work for has a department that focuses on electric meters and a department that focuses on water meters. Then separate, we have the department that reads the meters. We replace the meters before the life of the meter is reached and we test meters constantly. Any time a meter reading is unusually high, or low, we put a ticket out for the department that takes care of that meter. Any time a meter reader suspects there is something wrong with a meter, we test/replace that meter. Any time a customer complains about a their bill and swears they aren't using as much as the meter says, we replace the meter and test theirs. We also place a voltage recorder on their meter base. My company might be a little different in how we treat our customers because we are not a corporation trying to make a profit. We are a municipal improvement district. Owned by the people we serve.

"Hey there, not OP but have some thoughts.

The idea of a perfect, sound scientific theory is simply being able to explain all of the available evidence in a unified manor. As long as the scientific method is followed, and any conclusions are supported by the current available evidence, a theory must be viewed as potentially possible, and therefore valid. So when papers are peer-reviewed, it is the reliability of the data, and the validity of the methodology that are most strenuously scrutinized, along with the ability for any conclusions and discussion to integrate seamlessly with the newly presented, and wider established evidence.

Scientists that get hooked up on certain theories, dedicating their lives to refute any counter-evidence or alternative ideas, and/or twisting all other results into ""supporting"" their idea, are not conducting pure or correct science, and are allowing emotional attachment to interfere with perceived reality. This is, ideally, what the peer review process is for- to weed out the bad science. Of course, even if dubious theories manage to get published, the wider scientific community will conduct their own review and can write response papers highlighting any foul play/false conclusions, ultimately resulting in poor reputations for the initial propagators."

"There are, I think, two overlapping issues here.  1st is the ideological one - which is the notion that government is always the problem.  This one is rather entrenched and difficult to address in any brief conversation.  

The second is more practical, and I think can be addressed with two simple questions.  

1. Why should employers bear the cost of insuring their employees?  Freeing entrepreneurs and small business owners from health insurance *should* allow for a freer marketplace and make it easier for small businesses to hire and retain employees.

2. Where does profit come from in the health insurance industry?  Assuming the actuarial and risk-assessment element washes out (it doesn't, but just for the sake of argument), profit is made by a) investment income from premiums being higher than expected outlays, or b) denial of coverage.  

I don't think either of these are persuasive on their own, but the more I read social media posts and news stories the more I think that we need to have a policy-driven national conversation about how health insurance works - specifically adverse selection, pass-on costs, and premium support "

"&gt; You will now need to file for 2011 - 2014 tax years if you were enrolled at an eligible post-secondary institution for those years. 

I am not intending to challenge you, I'm just wondering about this - the credits will be earned and roll forward even if the OP does not file a return. AFAIK OP only needs to file a Schedule 11 for each year, and then submit the Schedule 11s for each of the missing years with either an amended 2015 return or their 2016 return. 

Don't get me wrong, I think OP *should* file the missing returns . . . I'm just wondering whether it is actually required or whether filing the Schedule 11s would be sufficient. I had always thought only the Schedule 11 was required. 

IMO the CRA website is somewhat ambiguous on this point:

I believe the CAPCOM for the first American flight, Shepard's Mercury-Redstone flight, was Deke Slayton, one of the 'Mercury 7' who was grounded before he could fly due to heart issues (but eventually flew in 1975 on the Apollo-Soyuz test project). Other famous CAPCOMs include Scott Carpenter who worked John Glenn's flight, the first American orbit, and who flew the next orbital mission; Charlie Duke, who worked the Apollo 11 landing and later walked on the moon with John Young on Apollo 16; and Jack Lousma, who worked Apollo 13 during the ""we've had a problem"" episode and later flew on Skylab, and then commanded STS-3.

"Hello again. I know anecdotes are great but here's a review of the current state of kidney transplants. I would assume we're talking pancreas only so...

&gt;Pancreas transplantation alone (PTA) is indicated in selected patients with T1DM and normal native kidney function, and makes up the smallest percentage of pancreas transplants performed, roughly 10% (see Fig. 1 ). In this situation the key consideration, in addition to surgical risk, is an assessment of the risk of immunosuppression, and to determine if that risk is outweighed by the risk of diabetes treated with intensive insulin therapy. For these patients, the risk-versus-benefit calculation typically favors PTA in patients who are good surgical candidates with low cardiac risk profiles and who are unaware of impending hypoglycemia owing to loss of counterregulatory mechanisms and hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure.

Also, graft survival at 3 years for pancreas only transplants is only just above 50%. Meaning that you'd have to get another one, or go back to insulin therapy. 

Here's the [review](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.evms.idm.oclc.org/pubmed/26895686) if your interested - it covers pancreas only, kidney pancreas, kidney before pancreas transplants. "

"It's possible.  You may be right.  

All I'm saying is that the fork into a  ""bitcoin silver and bitcoin gold"" model is a possible outcome that needs to be considered.  Just like when in investing in any business there are risks and rewards associated with any bold move.  If you refuse to consider the possible rewards you are a bad businessperson."
"This is a logical fallacy created by a research paper someone put out on the game theory of bitcoin when there is no block reward.  That research paper made a critical error in that it only optimized for miners obtaining the most bitcoin that they can, not the most economic value that they can.

When the block reward runs out, there's 2 scenarios each miner faces when building their next block:
 -Build a new block including all of the current transactions in the mem-pool
 -Build a new block attempting to orphan the previous block and ""steal"" their transactions + all the transactions in the mem-pool

The research paper found that through modeling, the 2nd scenario is likely to eventually play out because it provides the most bitcoin to the miner.  The simulation got stuck in a loop where each miner chooses option 2 and no new blocks would be generated.  What this simulation missed, was that by doing so the value of bitcoin would drop precipitously.  So while each miner maximizes their own bitcoin, they actually minimize the value that they are able to take through mining.  

Since in order to maintain bitcoin's value, additional blocks must be built on one another.  So there is significant incentive for any miner to eventually choose option 1, otherwise everyone's bitcoin goes to $0 USD.  

Once you assume that someone has to eventually choose option 1, you realize that it's actually game theory optimal to build on top of mined blocks that also choose option 1 because that leaves the highest number of fees in the mem-pool for the new block.  

Therefore, the system will continue to work just as well with no block reward as it does today.

As a side note, it's absolutely retarded to not scale bitcoin today because we might have a theoretical problem 130 years from now.  "

hello! i work in fast food too. i have oily/combo skin and i find that using a gel moisturizer helps keep my skin hydrated enough to where i won't turn into a grease ball by the end of my shift. i also notice that the primer i use for my make up helps keep the shine at bay as well. 
"I use Clear Complexions in Canberra and believe they have places in Sydney as well. Ultimately a combination of Omnilux and products got rid of mine. I no longer use the products they recommend because I use a combination of Korean and Japanese products with the same ingredients. 

Here's  a post about the treatments i wrote ages ago in response to a similar question. 

I have been going to Clear Complexions since late 2014 to help with a sudden outbreak of adult acne. I will give you a run down of the procedures I have had:

Omnilux- this is the main procedure that I have had and costs about $125 a session. Initially I had 2 sessions a week for 8 weeks and then reduced it to weekly. This was an expensive thing to do but I had my wedding coming up and my acne was really bad. They mainly used the blue and red lights on my skin so I have no idea what the others are like. Now I only have 1 session a month as maintenance. This procedure is completely pain free, you just lie under a light for 20 minutes. Surprisingly it was incredible effective and now I get maybe 1 or 2 small pimples a month 

Peel - They do a variety of peels at the clinic I go to and I can't remember which one I had or the price (sorry). I have super sensitive skin and have overall found using weaker actives at home more effective. 

IPL- I initially had this after my acne cleared up  to get rid of all my broken capillaries and other post-acne skin damage. This is one of my favourite things to have done because you can see the results very quickly. The procedure does hurt a tiny bit and feels like a hot elastic band flicking your face. From memory the initial session costs about $425 and then you have two follow up sessions that cost $120 (i think but my memory is a little fuzzy). A year later I had the procedure again. 

Overall I would recommend the clinic it does cost a little more but the staff there are nurses and are well trained. One thing I don't  like is that the only real skincare they have on offer is the Rationale range. If you know your ingredients you can find far superior products for less. I'm not stingy with skincare but I certainly thing $92 for a cleanser is stupid. 

In the past I have had both relaxing and ""business"" facials and tend to only have ""business"" ones now. If you have any questions I'm happy to answer them.

"Okay, after a quick look at your site, the biggest flaw I see is no prominent call to action on the homepage.

As soon as I open your site, I'm a little lost as to what is you do or what you want from me. Take this site for example: https://gogetfunding.com/

When I open the page I see that they're a fundraising site, not only that but I'm able to start a fundraiser in once click.

My advice would be to throw some text on the main banner, a quick line explaining who you are and what you do. A button underneath which links to your receive a quote form, so that users know where to go if they'd like to use your service.

Also, if you're in the drone business why is there no mention of ""drones"" anywhere on the site? Drones are hot right now in google search results, sell it!

Yes, a huge percentage of our produce is grown in the Central Valley and elsewhere in California and yes, these growers depend on cheap, seasonal (often illegal) labor and yes, our produce prices would go up if they didn't have it.  But no, this doesn't make it right.

If illegal seasonal workers are willing to pick strawberries for 50% of the minimum wage, those same people would be quite willing to pick strawberries for minimum wage.  The solution is to completely reboot the system so that we have a formal program of seasonal agricultural visas that actually works and is followed.

Both sides of this argument are wrong.  The people that pass laws like this just want to preserve the status quo, no matter how disastrously unfair and exploitative it is.  The Trumps of the world want to blow it up, without putting much thought into the huge economic impact it will have.  If they blew it up with a sound plan to immediately address the impact, that would be one thing, but that isn't what they are going to do."
"[How about straight from Cam Battley's mouth?] (http://magazine.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/article/march-2017/10-questions-with-cam-battley.aspx)

&gt; Katz: Can you offer some insights in terms of scheduling a project of this scale? How do you time all the permits required, the construction, inspections and all the additional regulatory hurdles required of licensed producers to schedule an anticipated opening?
 
&gt; Battley: We‚Äôre fortunate in that our CEO Terry Booth has extensive career experience in permitting and construction and has assembled an expert team to manage the process under his supervision. ... It‚Äôs a top priority, and we‚Äôre targeting completion before the end of 2017, so we‚Äôre taking a very methodical approach to ensure we stay on track and on schedule.

"Billboards and advertising add something to cities when it is well done. A lot of design work and expense goes into ads which also cycle on a regular basis.

Now that we've determined what the GWG *is* and what it *isn't*, let's ask the important questions: Why are fewer women in lucrative industries, and how can we encourage more equal opportunity for the next generation? Why are women more likely to choose jobs with flexible/fewer hours, and is our society/culture/workforce missing something that might close that gap? And in industries where we do see an increased likelihood of overt gender discrimination, what can we do to make it better?"

"This has to be a troll but if you are actually asking here ...

So all companies are different but lots of insiders control the stock, especially newer companies . Meaning the founders the CEO/President may own 50% or more of the stock or the sitting president and VP and a few other executives probably own over 50%

However even if there is NO concentrated stock owner ship , Coca Cola has a market cap of 183.05 billion. Lets say you need 5% to become the largest share holder and vote yourself CEO.

You still would need 9.1 Billion dollars. Most people will never come close to earning that much. You really think you can over 30 years save 9.1 billion dollars?

Potentially you could do that with a very small cap stock or penny stock but most are pump/dump schemes and will go bankrupt before you buy enough shares to vote yourself CEO.

"I'm not the one complaining that these companies are an issue! I'm merely defending their right as a business to do what they can to make money.

I understand why Comcast and TW have the size and power they do, and given the same opportunity I would do the same thing for my business. If I could be the absolute leader in an industry, i would do it in a heart beat. That is what life is about, its about being the best you can, because when everyone is doing good, so much more gets done.

I don't sit around and complain that I can't afford stuff, I make an effort to be able to afford it. It is up to me and no one else to get me through life. I don't wait for others to give me an advantage, I make the advantage myself. A so called *go getter*.

"Hi! I'm in the same boat! I have had 4 businesses as well and have failed 2 as well. I live in south orange county, california, but my businesses have been mostly web based. My first business was Tee shirt line that I started with a couple of friends. We sold a couple but I realized my friends weren't as motivated as I was and the whole thing kind of fell apart. I consider it a failure, but I still have the shirts and some people still ask to buy them every once and a while so it isn't a complete failure. My second business was selling handmade goods on Etsy.com. I got a couple sales, but had to shut it down when I realized my products weren't in compliance with Etsy's TOS, but I still sell the products on another site, but my focus is now elsewhere because the market I was in was really oversaturated. Im now on my 3rd and 4th businesses. My 3rd is a drop shipping business based off Ebay selling electronics. I have had a little bit more success with this and I am starting to average $20 a week in profit. And my 4th business is a work in progress with the same business plan of the ebay business but on an apple store app called Mercari! Hopefully this is what you were asking for!

"On that front I would measure SpaceX from Grasshopper, in 2013, not 2010; Blue Origin aren't going to spend years going in that particular wrong direction. Although space is hard, I do think New Glenn is going to be easier to get right, for the reasons I've already given. It's a bigger rocket and so has bigger margins. It undoubtedly helps them to have seen what SpaceX does, too.

And while things may go wrong for Blue Origin, they may go wrong for SpaceX, too. I'm concerned about whether SpaceX can increase its cadence without a RUD. They're aiming for around 20 launches in 2017, 30 in 2018, and they'll probably be up to one a week by 2020. If they have 99% reliability on each launch, that's still a 50% chance of failure over 75 launches. 99% is high for the industry, and so far there's no evidence that they can exceed it."

"I fundamentally agree with you, but that's an idealistic view of what Bitcoin _should_ be but is _not_ reflected by reality at all. In theory, we should be able to use bitcoin without trusting any central authority, be it developers or miners, but the truth is, they have all the power to dictate the future direction of bitcoin, as evidenced by the ongoing brouhaha. If you use or hold bitcoin, you are in fact trusting them, and their ideological views. In a nutshell, that's my problem with Bitcoin in 2017 -- it's all about ideology, and not about pragmatism. Ethereum's developers are extremely pragmatic.

Regarding conflicts of interest, one thing that does give me trust also is that the developers of Ethereum pre-allocated a number of tokens to fund the development itself, so their future wealth is directly tied to the successful adoption of the platform. Therefore, I do trust them far more than Bitcoin's developers, since it's much less likely that they will be bought as Core has been. "

"The OpenDime is a pretty crazy idea.. essentially a hardware sidechain!  A ""Bitcoin Piggy-bank"" was the best description.  It seems well-designed and has good answers for all the usual concerns.

As Bitcoin gains value, my main issue with OpenDime is that it's inherently not backed-up.  It can't be backed-up, just like cash.  If you put a whole BTC on it, and it gets fried by static shock, dropped in the gutter, or sent through the washing machine, the BTC is gone.  If you put much LESS value in it, then you've burdened your 0.010 BTC with a consumable cost of around USD $15, and would be reluctant to give it to anyone in trade.

I suppose I would be happy to receive an OpenDime as payment, but not so eager to spend one.

This means funds will accumulate on one unit until they're uncomfortably large and worth breaking open the piggy bank.

I wonder if it could be made safe and ""re-usable"".. perhaps by resealing via switch, reverting to factory-new condition (ready for new entropy and deposits).  Then you could sweep the funds off it and re-use it for a lesser amount.

"&gt; Let me know when there's a way to measure user consensus before a potential change thats not vulnerable to sybil attack.

It can be done: 

* No significant opposition from developers 

* Implementation and support from **all significant development teams**

* Letters of support and commitment to run the client across industry

* Node flagging

* Miner flagging

* No significant opposition at conferences/meetups


Ironically, very similar to the strong demonstration of widespread ecosystem opposition to BU, just in reverse.  

Actually many industry players have recently come out and said what they expect from a hardfork, in order to consider supporting it and calling this new coin Bitcoin:

* Replay protection

* Onchain coordination process

* Wipe out protection

Please note that BU does none of these things.  Even the most basic.

"As someone who works in high tech with a number of H-1B teamates, I don't support what Trump is doing. It's a complex issue. On the bad side, I have seen people with H-1B visas get lower salaries, work long hours, and get treated like they are stuck because their visa is tied to their employment. I don't see how these changes to the visa process would address this issues, other than raising the salary requirements.

I don't see how this will help companies. There is a shortage of tech workers, both US born, and from other countries. Whenever we interview for a new position it takes a long time to find someone. I see no evidence of some large pool of high skilled and unemployed US engineers. In my experience, you have a better chance of getting hired if you are a citizen, it's less paperwork and lawyer work."

"I think yes.  Ms. Marvel was fantastic.  Miles Morales in the Ultimate Universe was AMAZING.  Black Panther is one of the top sellers for Marvel right now.  Good writing can and does make diversity-style characters, minority heroes in general really, succeed.  Buuuuut there's an underlying problem that is causing Marvel's sales to tank.

Before I start, let it be known, I consider things as 'characters' and 'brands'.  Tony Stark, Peter Parker, Miles Morales, these are characters.  Ms. Marvel, Captain America, Spider-Man, Thor, these are brands.

The issues plaguing Marvel are that their successful characters, especially those that have taken up an already existing brand, they are diluting too far amongst multiple series with too many different writers causing the characterization to be diluted, and cannibalizing its own customer base.  Marvel doesn't seem to understand that by putting Ms. Marvel on her own series, in Avengers series, in the Champions series, that they're pitting each of those series against each other for customers who follow Ms. Marvel, customers simply aren't going to buy all those series like Marvel wants them to, so the characters titles start losing in sales either from fatigue or poor quality or dilution of their favorite characters that it becomes too hard to follow what all they're in.

Then there's brand dilution, and this is just inexcusable.  You have a lot of characters that check a diversity box taking up a brand, only to have the old character or someone who doesn't check the boxes still carrying the brand as well.  Falcon becoming Captain America while Steve Rogers is still Captain America, Lady Thor and Unworthy Thor, Kate Bishop and Hawkeye, Miles Morales and Peter Parker.  This again is cannibalizing the customers who follow a specific brand, causing both series to suffer as consumers won't magically start buying both.

So no, diversity isn't the problem in and of itself.  Its Marvel trying to insert diversity while doing this other, really there's no polite way to say this, this other stupid shit.  Really, I have an MBA, I'm probably the business version of the sophmore (aka the wise idiot) and I'm seeing this dilution and this eating away at their own consumer base as just purely idiotic.  Doesn't matter if Captain America is a black man or a hispanic teen girl or what have you, with business practices like Marvel's been showing, and this isn't even the tip of the iceberg of what's wrong with the comics industry as a whole, its no wonder Marvel's sales are metaphorically (and in some unfortunate cases quite literally) shitting the bed.

But nooooo, diversity is the problem, comic fans just aren't accepting minority and female and non-heterosexual characters!  Fuck that.  Pushing diversity is a symptom of the disease, not the disease itself.  The disease itself is that the comics industry has a brain cancer growing in it that Marvel doesn't know how to cure, and seems prone to making these piss poor business decisions as a result."
"&gt; You can't demand on fewer exemptions, deductions and other ""loopholes"" that allow the ""rich"" to avoid paying their fair share of taxes and then use those same exemptions, deductions and loopholes to avoid paying what you claim you owe.

Sanders doesn't claim they owe more, he says that they should owe more. Warren Buffet does exactly what you say Sanders shouldn't do, and he makes enough money that his ""donations"" would actually make a small difference in the federal budget. Sanders, if he sent more than he owed, wouldn't even show up as a rounding error.

"Ok, I'll concede, my comment is being ""intellectually dishonest"" because it did not consider other people's opinion about when life begins or the rights of an unborn child. And to be Frank (I'd have to change my name, hey-yoooo), your opinion means very little to me. However, the current legal standard is Roe v Wade. Until that is overturned, this is whole discussion is pretty open and shut, at least to me. She is afforded the right to opt into or out of an abortion regardless of your ethical standards. You and fellow conservatives may disagree with this right afforded to citizens and that's fine, go ahead, that's your prerogative. But the fact is, she is defending her rights as a US citizen and is protected under the law. Whether or not you think abortion is ethical or not is beside the point. She cannot be jailed or imprisoned for exercising her rights as a US citizen. If you want it changed, advocate for change. Until then, you have to bite your tongue and accept that Tomi is pro choice. Stop watching her, scream at the top of your lungs to anyone that is willing to listen to your terrible opinions, write letters to other conservative blogs and media to ban her, do whatever you want, that's your right as a citizen. If she made the decision to be pro-choice and pays the social repercussions, that's her choice, not yours and it's well within her rights to do so. 

So where do you go from here? Are you willing to break the law and prohibit her rights as a US citizen because you disagree on an ethical level? I'm guessing the answer to that question is no, hence my extremely simple comment stating that she is exercising her rights as a citizen afforded to her under protection of the law. It's truly that simple. Abiding by the laws of our country and standing up for the rights afforded to citizens is a core conservative value that I stand behind 100%. 

Just to be absolutely clear, I support anyone that wants to exercise their lawful rights regardless of their political agenda. I will attempt to not use stereotypes when making arguments or make immature generalizations about someone I hardly know like make wild accusations and assumptions, like your last comment that assumes I share every liberal post from some dumb website; that's a child's level retort only reserved for people that use attacks rather than credible talking points (I mean, it's Reddit so you take the good you take the bad and there you have, the facts of life).  

I disagree with Tomi a lot but I will defend her for exercising her rights afforded as a US citizen. Same with any other citizen or group of citizens. I denounce the KKK unequivocally but I defend their rights to free speech. As a fiscally conservative but socially liberal citizen (I hope your head exploded hearing that), this is my version of freedom. Again, if you don't like the current version of freedom in our country, you can go advocate for change or you can find a country that is more suitable to your liking. More or less, if you don't like it you can get out. "

"While many here might disagree with the article I think it is quite right. The religious right has lost power and influence steadily for decades now (a good thing), but GOP power and representation on the federal and state level is very high, for example they hold 33 governorships which ties a 94 year old record. Christian conservatives voted for Trump not because he was religious (he's not) but because he was more conservative than Hillary. I would consider myself a conservative secular atheist, and I voted for Trump. While nationalism might be a bad word to many here, to me it is not. It simply means patriotism and that nations should act in their own interests. If you think states should be able to do things their own way, instead of a one size fits all, you might be a nationalist. Its opposite Internationalism is the idea that nations should cooperate more and ignore the diversity of thought and culture among themselves. This I think is a dangerous idea because it concentrates power and increases the likelihood of authoritarianism. Having more local and state control rather than national and international control is a barrier against tyranny."

"I think a part of this is people misconstrue tranny as being a pervert. It is a mental disorder, in most cases, but not dangerous to others, mostly to themselves. 

 The issue here is no women want men in women's rooms with them, and vice versa. For the most part. Perverts perving in any bathroom is messed up, regardless of label. But what reasonable mom or dad would want a dude in the bathroom with their daughter? I dont have kids, but i imagine its the same for boys too. Its often presented as purely men in womens room. Well, thats because men are often the perverts, or the offenders.  But im sure parents worry about it in boys rooms, too. 

 It becomes a problem when parents are pushing agenda on their kids. Wanting their kids to be gay. Giving toddlers hormones. Trying to change our language and science. Or how society thinks is best for their kids safety and privacy and such. Like a boy with a schlong in girls locker room in school. Happens. Its messed up.

"&gt; You are accepting science to a large degree by telling me this via a computer over the Internet. Do you apply your argument to this realm, too?

Of course I do. What I am saying is that even if the computer and internet works the way you want it, you don't know what the fuck is going on. You may know how to use a cell phone, but how the your voice is converted to digital signal, propagates via optical fiber and gets converted back to voice is what you don't know. You may argue that you don't need to as it works fine, but that holds true only till everything works fine. We all know that when shit fails, people start freaking out. It is only an outcome of ignorance. If you use something without knowing how it works, be ready to face the consequences of not knowing. Its called the Law of Karma. I don't know how you can disprove this.

And what you think as science is actually technology. Science is more abstract and fundamental, technology is what most people interact and know in day to day life. (Like your computer and internet example). Same with religion. The religious philosophies are abstract and very difficult to demonstrate in everyday life but are true nonetheless. The problem with religion right now is that the technological aspect of it i.e the one which people interact and see everyday, has been badly destroyed and misused. Just because you don't see that, does not mean that the theories and abstract knowledge is false.

In fact, the technology is developed only when people made an effort and paid to bring the fruits of technology to their doorsteps (again like computer and internet). If people did the same with religion/spirituality, it is not very far away that we will see those things being claimed in books like clairvoyance, mind reading, teleportation, future prediction etc. If people want religion to work for them, they need to pay for it, not just in money, but in time and social support. Otherwise, it won't work. Not even science will develop itself without social support. Think about those large LIGO and LHC projects."

"You seem to be having a trouble with understanding percentages in a binary distribution. 

If you have a vote with only two options, and one option gets 51% and the other gets 49%, you do not need 2% of people to change their votes to change the outcome.

In a binary vote, every vote that goes to one option comes out the expense of another. The totals always have to add up to 100%.

The amount Leave won by is 1.9(1)%, because if you take that off the Leave vote then the Remain vote would have won.

It would not be possible for Leave to win by 49.9%."

I for one would love to get paid a flat rate. Clients could pay all the expenses associated with listing and marketing a home and I could get paid regardless of if the home sold or not. The fact is most people don't want to pay up front and that's why we have commissions.

Realtors take a financial risk with every property they sell, even when they don't get paid. So yes, I'm all for changing the system, but sadly most people don't want to pay money up front and no matter what.

I also don't see us as controlling the mls. Comfree can get your house on that no problem. I'll send people info on solds in their area even if they don't want to use me. Information is free and I do a lot more than slap a listing on mls to sell it."

"That's because you're a fucking idiot.

I'll put it into simple terms that even you'll be able to grasp.

There are an estimated 2.2 billion Christians around the world. Are they a single homogeneous group who are accountable for each other?

Surely Quakers are responsible for the actions of Christian fundamentalists who advocate and have killed doctors who carry out terminations, despite Quakers being pacifists? 

Or maybe Coptic Christians should take responsibility for the sectarian violence that has occurred in Northern Ireland for decades, nay, for centuries, between Protestants and Catholics? Maybe if they all just stood up they could wipe out those radicals.

Beginning to get the picture yet?

There are two main groups on Islam: Sunnis and Shias but then you have a thousand different small splinter sects that each follow their own interpretation of the Koran, and then you have a special group in all that called Wahabism that is prevalent in Saudi Arabia, which is a special close ally of the US, who incidentally love to sell weapons to them, while at teh same time, the majority of the terrorists who carried out the largest terrorist act against the US came from that country. It is even said that it was Wahabi money that funded them.

You want someone to step up and stop Islamic fundamentalism then look to your own fucking government that is best pals with one unequivocal source of fundamentalism while it bombs the shit out of others merely for being in the way."

"The first thing you should do is make friends with someone else in the business.  Find someone that has gone through this and knows how the game works.  Every business has it's inside baseball that you need to know.  It sounds like you grew up spending a lot of time at the rink so you probably know a lot, but find out everything.

This kind of business can be tricky from what I understand.  Part of the issue is the high capital costs of constructing a facility.  The rink itself isn't too pricey but the building and land could be.   The more you think outside the box the quicker you will reach your goal.

For example around here one group built a rink in a space that used to be a grocery store.  It's not the best rink around but it works well for hockey.

You also might be able to start cheap in one location and eventually move to a better location.  E.g. start in a warehouse or something.

Regardless you need a solid business plan that lays out what the business itself looks like as well as the capital expenditures required to get it going.

One final thought, it might very well be worth it to get into the league business yourself if you own a rink.  Running a league can actually be fairly lucrative if you get it big enough.  Also running all of the kids programs, kids leagues etc. as part of the rink itself.  Scrape up those dollars for your business instead of letting a 3rd party have them.

This kind of business is likely going to come down to location location location... Good luck!

"And this:

&gt;I agree that maybe the Clinton campaign was a bit arrogant in their handling the disgruntled nascent Berniecrats and their demands for populism (despite populism's sordid history), and perhaps made the mistake of assuming they would all vote for her if they voted at all - in light of that, trying to cultivate the moderate Republicans made plenty of sense and there was a lot of dissent within the Republican ranks, with many organizations crossing party lines for the first time in over a hundred years.

Can't let that load of shit pass:  

**The Clinton campaign was arrogant and incompetent in their complete dismissal of a body of support that included Berniecrats, independents, roughly half the Democratic party and a sprinkling of Republicans that was larger than the entire party base, and their policy ideas rooted in human need, despite clear and favorable history in the New Deal, and said policy being aligned with the majority population in said need, and took the risk associated with assuming these people would all vote for her if they voted at all, because of how terrible Trump was, and how attractive she thought a woman President would be, when coupled with fear, shame and blame advocacy having little to do with the important economic issues we face today.  In light of those profound disconnects, trying to cultivate the moderate Republican votes seemed like a good idea as it would counter a popular policy platform, while taking advantage of apparent dissent within the Republican ranks, with many organizations crossing party lines for the first time in over a hundred years.  Never mind that having absolutely nothing to do with the growing need and poverty and it's importance to the people.  This display of near complete ignorance of political realities, coupled with profound hubris, resulted in one of the all time political losses that put the Democratic Party down an epic 1000+ seats in the span of a mere 6 years.**

You know it's OK to just say she fucked up, was selfish and incompetent.  That is the truth.  It's also OK to say the Democratic Party was OK with that, making the call, ""her turn"", despite the fact that it's really our call, not theirs to make too.  More truth.

And populism has many forms.  There isn't anything in our ideas one can associate with the worse bits of history, and a whole lot of it we can associate with perfectly fine New Deal era ideas that did the nation well.

"&gt; You may be happy that they lied, but as someone who thinks that parties should actually do what they said they would in the campaign and in their manifestos, think it's wrong.

Sounds like you agree with the SNP then, as their manifesto said:

&gt;We believe that **the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold another referendum** if there is clear and sustained evidence that independence has become the preferred option of a majority of the Scottish people ‚Äì or **if there is a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will.**

The Scottish Green's manifesto was quite clear:

&gt; If a new referendum is to happen, it should come about by the will of the people, and not be driven by calculations of party political advantage. In such a referendum the Scottish Greens will campaign for independence.

The gulf between how Scotland and rUK over Brexit cannot simply be ignored, and I think many Scottish Greens feel that the will of the people is that an independence referendum is the best route to preserving EU membership."
"Did she ask what are the payscales and budgets for the entire Education dept? Because the employment numbers are up so someone must get employed.

I guess it's the usual. Public unions and bureaucracies want more money so they stop collecting garbage from the streets but keep paying themselves bonuses, business trips and diversity trainings because everybody knows those are the centerpiece of of their work! And if the public doesn't want to pay even more out of their pocket so that they can squeeze another gold-plated retirement scheme they can live with garbage.

I cared about these things until I saw this sort of bullying at work. You want something to change? Then go on a strike demanding better management and return to principles and focusing on educating children! Not more money to be sunk in the black hole that is the education system."

&gt;other nations regulate healthcare in smart and effective ways and yield better results.

I did address this, I said that a single payer system could work better than what America has now. My point is that a deregulated system would work even better, like the mutual aid societies of the past.

&gt;Most people are quite satisfied that there are regulations on food safety, water quality, and environmental protection.

Just because the government does something good, does not mean it does it well or is the only one that could do it.  I wouldn't eat somewhere that wasn't certified by a trusted brand, and I would sue the shit out of any company that affected the substantive use of my property through pollution.

Yeah, when the only way you can get returns is in stocks that is to be expected. 

Subsidising low-income families who have children also isn't a big help. Poor people get more welfare for having more kids, and those kids are more likely to be poor and have poor kids. Compound that for 60 years and you have a sizable demographic of statistically uneducated, abused, and government dependent people. A middle-class family is fully on the hook for the cost of their children, and have less kids because of it. 

&gt;We hardly have equal opportunity. Good luck being born in some shitty town and trying to get ahead with few resources and shitty schools.

&gt;fiscal stimulus, infrastructure investments, and loans focused on small businesses and individuals seeking re-finance. Instead, the classic conservative move of getting into bed with Wall Street was done yet again.

This goes back to the economic calculation problem. You can't distribute money more efficiently than the market can. People smarter than you or I have tried, and failed every time. 

&gt;Romanians, Bulgarians, and Croatians have a higher income than Scandinavians. Yet their nations are nowhere near as good as the Scandinavian nations.

My point is that these people consistently perform better in a nation with a freer market than their home country, Soviet occupation and the Balkan war also dont put those countries on equal footing with Sweden.

As for homogeneous societies, it depends on the society. A homogeneous culture with good values will do better than one with bad values. Western values have consistently been the ones which are the most successful, and the places with the highest concentration of westerners tend to do the best. It reduces conflict and helps develop a national conciousness. "

Definitely agree with you on using BS anecdotes in a discussion. As far as his anecdote, though, it honestly doesn't seem very far fetched to me. It's shitty behavior to be sure, but people in this industry are not shy about how they want to hire more women but can't.

I guess we're going to have to agree to disagree, though. I don't think I'm really going to convince you of anything here, and you're definitely not going to convince me that this sort of hiring discrimination doesn't happen when I've seen it firsthand at least half a dozen times."

Throughout the oceans, there are several fragments of isolated continental crust, this being one of them.

The difference here is that Zealandia is much larger in area.

Perhaps sad but interesting, I do not think there are any other hidden continents, although maybe one or two microcontinents. This because are maps of the seafloor (enhanced hugely through satellites) have become much better; that is, there are no large masses of elevated seafloor not already known.

What made Zealandia interesting is that, while we knew this portion of the seafloor to elevated for a long time, and underlain continental crust, we did not know until recently that all was truly connected. "

"I get where you're coming from, but I imagine whether the car is designed to favour passengers/pedestrians will just get agreed upon and regulated. As you suggested.

Your next point though I think is a stretch just back up your thinking the technology is far away.

Autonomous cars are already statistically safer, partly because they're able to react quicker than humans. And their ability to concentrate on many things happening at once, and infer how to stay out of danger will only improve.

The argument to segregate them due to the human drivers being the danger doesn't make sense to me.

Additionally the humans 'fucking' with them is hyperbole. That's already possible with other human drivers, and is both highly dangerous and highly illegal.

The roads won't be segregated for 1 reason, **money**. No one will pay for it, and it's completely unnecessary.

And, funnily enough, money is also the reason why autonomous cars will be relentlessly pursued by companies and will absolutely take over.

I don't think I've seen anyone who doubts the speed of uptake in autonomous cars consider the economic side of them. There are massive, *MASSIVE* economic incentives to developing the tech. 

You could run a taxi company with no drivers to pay, massively increasing your profits. Or do the same with delivery trucks/vans.

Also it opens up all kinds of new business models, like not owning a car and paying a monthly fee to on-demand 'summon' a car whenever you need one. Just that one business model has the potential to fundamentally alter how transport works (and make a lot of money for the people running it)."

"Assuming you accept the results of this study (which I'm not sure you should, it was retrospective, makes some massive assumptions about the cause of cardiac arrest, mostly ignores pre-existing conditions, completely ignores that nearly all of the patients examined were also taking far more powerful drugs like ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, antidepressants, anxiolytics, morphine, etc), there was no significantly significant association between increased risk of cardiac arrest and naproxen. There's a reason why this is published in a fairly obscure journal with an impact factor of only 2.1"

"&gt; The article is not even about welfare, but mainly how finacial hardships can easily force you into punishing and crippling situations.

&gt;It‚Äôs time to revive the notion of a collective national responsibility to the poorest among us, who are disproportionately women and especially women of color. 

The article implicitly states that we should return to the welfare state. It condemns Reagan's criticism of welfare and Clinton's Welfare Reform. It makes an argument for collectivism over individualism.

&gt;I'm not sure you really read the article, or maybe you are simply against the working poor being able to afford necessities and being able to work out of being poor by hard work.

If the poor want to buy more, they should work harder. I've met plenty of poor people. Those that escaped worked hard, those that remained in poverty generally did the bare minimum and then continued to blame society for their problems."

My daughter (12 yo) has curly hair but wants straight hair so badly bc she's got different coloring than I do, and she thinks the curls look ""gross"" with blonde hair. She just wants to ""fit in"" so badly. It kills me because she is complimented everywhere we go. She's model material. But kids can be mean. Especially jealous girls. The crazy thing?

The economic arguement for equalization is very strong. Let me give an example of a monetary union unable to effectively deal with asymmetric shocks; the Eurozone. Canada much like Europe houses many local economies that can vary greatly. The country can be growing on a whole but with some provinces being in a huge boom while  others can be in a deep recession all at the same time. If this situation happened between two countries a floating exchange rate can act as an adjustment mechanism. But in a monetary union this doesn't exist, so a fiscal mechanism is used instead of a monetary one."

"Which disasters would those be? Because Europe for the most is a pretty nice place to live and incredibly politically stable. Furthermore there's no evidence of anyone losing work or salary because of EU migrants coming to the UK, it's just the block of labour fallacy.

Truth is that so often it's racist ideas, consciousness or unconscious, that make people believe hysterical false narratives like the idea that Europe is in crisis due to immigration, or that their salaries aren't as high as they should be because of EU migrants, or that jobs are being exported out of the UK. 

Why is it always people who've never been to Cologne to say it's being overtaken by Muslim sex offenders, or people who've never been to Malmo who think the city is a war zone? Europe has far fewer problems than it did even 20 years ago, it's in the medias interest to stir up drama and convince you everything is just terrible.

We're hand waving them away because they're objectively not true, they're just narratives tabloids like to press because it sells papers.

"Wow! Clearly you don't understand that ""settled"" law remains so indefinitely, unless SCOTUS reverses itself.

You also lack historical perspective, if you think 100 years is ""old"" in the context of our legal system.

For context, ""the impairment of another person's rightful autonomy,"" remains the modern legal definition of ""violent assault"" - a definition written 310 years ago (Keeble v Hickeringill).

""Settled law"" is far more clearly enforceable, more certainly meaningful, than ""novel law."" It routinely takes decades for ""novel law"" to be fully tested to and through SCOTUS, to become ""settled law,"" and there can be laws a Century old that still remain ""novel,"" still untested before SCOTUS.

""The right to be known as if from birth by any chosen identity"" is such ""settled law,"" and a vital matter of living US law and public safety. It is in no way the 'triviality' that you want to believe it to be.

Most products as a general rule need to be kept under 28 or 30 degrees in a cool and dark place. I'd stick it in a fridge or a different room since the FTE is a product you're concerned about.
"An FTE is a type of essence which primarily consists of ferments.  Galactomyces is a type of ferment. FTEs are usually used for brightening, softening, and better absorption of other products in your routine. They are the first step after cleansing and actives and before your hydrating toners. As with all products, YMMV especially since many people here are sensitive to ferments on the skin especially if have fungal acne or had bacterial skin infections in the past. This will make it worse.

Other essences can be used for brightening, hydration, etc. but they don't usually have ferments. If you haven't used either of this product and if you are located in the USA, I highly recommend you buy some decants from /r/asianbeautyexchange "

"Surprisingly large amounts of gamers really don't. 

I mean, pcmr does everything it can drawing in the console crowds. Alienware sells tons. 

There's a large number of people who like gaming on the PC but who really aren't into the tech side of it. 

That doesn't mean they wouldn't like extra frames. The fact that you think everyone who needs the performance knows this shit is because you too easily assume everyone must be like you. 

Plenty of guys with expensive cars know jack shit about engines. Even more people who dream about those cars don't. It's the real enthusiasts that obviously do, but different from what you'd expect that's the minority of people who would like to own a ferrari.

"I would assume a mix of both right? If you are physically sabotaging the car to make it structurally unsound in the event of a crash, you would then want to hack the car to ensure a crash in some way as the car was left somewhat functional to create a malfunction whilst the car was being used.

For example if we look at his own crash and how he was last seen travelling at max speed and his engine was on fire, they sabotaged the engine to cause a malfunction, and hack the software to force acceleration/prevent breaking once he reaches a certain speed (say only a speed you would reach on a highway). This way you have a fallback if physical or digital sabotage aren't enough, and assuming the skill/preparation ability of an intelligence agency like the CIA or FBI can essentially guarantee a high speed crash with very low chances of survival."

"&gt;Agriculture is currently capital intensive, as agriculture is industrialised. In the agricultural societies of the past, that is a society whose political and economic institutions were based on the production and consumption of agricultural goods, agriculture was labour intensive.

Either way, agriculture does not require a highly educated populace.

"FYI: ""inverse"" doesn't mean that it goes up or down. Ie, an inversely exponential graph could start at zero and shoot up, depending on what the original function was that you are taking the inverse of. 

Same with ""inversely"" linear.

Inversely proportional implies that the magnitude of Y axis decreases with an increase in the x axis. Directly proportional would be the opposite. 

I guess if I had a summary here, it would be that the word ""inversely"" isn't very helpful without the word ""proportional."" But that's fine, because in this context you could just say ""I expected it to be exponential/logarithmic and not linear."""

"Yes, I think your maths is correct and that this could be a good idea for some people (and have suggested it on recent threads).

Reasons to go the other way include:

* employer contributions - it's always worth collecting those.  But you could do a split approach and save minimum amount into pension to collect the match, and the rest into ISA.

* salary sacrifice - contributions via salary sacrifice avoid NI contributions, and it also saves your employer NI contributions (which they might put towards your pension as well).  But you can work around this by saving into an ISA now, then later sacrificing salary (and living off the ISA proceeds if necessary).

* contribution limits - if you want to build up ISA savings anyway, depending on earnings the ¬£20,000 limit might get in the way.  Also, the ¬£40,000 per year (and earnings) limit might affect contributions to pension later.  You can carry forward annual allowance from previous years but you would still be limited to earnings.  And limits could change in future.

* inheritance - pensions don't attract IHT or contribute towards the estate (only relevant if total estate is above ¬£325,000).

* means tested benefits - I'm not an expert on this, but there are circumstances where ISAs count towards your net worth but pensions don't.

* tax rule changes - this could go either way, so the rules could move against you.  However, on balance I'm swayed by your argument that savings in the ISA will be accessible in the shorter term if needed and less vulnerable to future unpredictable rules changes.

"If you're sharing accomodations, AirBnB is offering a lower-quality service than the hotel and you should expect to pay less. But if you're *not* sharing accomodations, AirBnB is very likely offering a significantly higher-quality service than the hotel: better kitchen, nicer  furniture, and of course, the unit is not in a hotel. So why wouldn't you pay more?

I'm guessing it just doesn't fit your needs. The times that I've used AirBnB we had a large group renting out the unit, so the per-person worked out cheaper than a hotel."

"Unsourced? The SW devs themselves are the source, and it's still included on the Bitcoincore.org page itself (last updated in November 2016):

&gt;Segregated witness therefore takes advantage of this opportunity to raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use **(this effectively results in an effective limit closer to 1.6 to 2 MB).**

[Is BitcoinCore itself a good source?](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/)

That said, if every tx uses the new Segwit address format, which isn't implemented yet, and every tx in a single block is also a complex SW multisig tx of some sort, we may see some blocks with an effective size above 2MB.

You know as well as I do, though, that such a case is highly unlikely."

"What's even more bizarre is when/if the core 1MB chain activates segwit. Those transactions are still valid on BU, right? That's why they were aiming for soft-fork right? 

~~Those ANYONECANSPEND transactions will be interesting to see on BU. Kinda makes me nervous to see how those coins get snatched up.~~

~~If you're a segwit supporter and decide to stick to the smaller segwit chain and decide to actually spend your coins via a segwit transaction, your coins will not ever be available to you on the Unlimited chain should you ever decide the segwit chain is dead and reluctantly switch to BU.~~

~~IMO, it would behoove you to NOT use segwit in the event of a fork, no matter how much of a die-hard segwit supporter you are.~~

Edit: after going back and rereading how segwit transactions are built, it SEEMS like they'll be considered invalid on the BU chain - they'll be seen as a transaction with 0 inputs and should never make it into a block. I'll leave my above comment crossed out though. "

"I disagree with your third point. I think couples that communicate well outside of the bedroom will still have a different, more intimate, form of communication after sex than they do during the rest of the day. Sex facilitates an intimate setting where you are automatically more vulnerable than you are if you're, say, cuddling on the couch. Even if you said the same words to each other while cuddling and watching a movie, they would feel more meaningful if said when lying naked in bed after being physically connected during sex.

Not to mention that sex releases hormones in your brain that will help you be more likely to say the nice things to each other in the first place. Even if you're already in a happy relationship and communicating well, you'll be at a heightened level of happiness right after sex, and more likely to say something nice or more meaningful than usual."

No, I think they've been lied to by this community.  This community clearly has some fundamental misunderstanding of how bitcoin actually works.

Nope, that's like pushing on a string.   The entire network is well aware what is happening.   As the transaction backlog grows, so do the fees.   The fees may end up doubling the current block reward and will entice greedy miners, to switch back to Bitcoin Core.   

BU order books will be empty, since its a freshly created altcoin, with barely any transactions, since no one but miners and /r/btc will be running nodes.  No economic entities will be running BU, because it's too dangerous to run in its current form.  (will erase all history if Bitcoin Core surpases it)   BU is trying to play an all or nothing game, which is far too risky for sensible businesses to participate in.

"It depends.  As I understand it, there are theoretical attacks that could cripple a coin so severely immediately following a fork that it doesn't even survive until the next difficulty period.

If/when there is a hardfork, both chains will be mining more slowly, since existing hashpower will be split between them.

Let's say there is a malicious mining pool who supports the side that already has more hash power.  What they could do is start mining empty blocks on the weaker side.  Or if they were powerful enough, they could mine several empty blocks, and delay broadcasting them, causing other ""legitimate"" blocks mined on that chain to be orphaned.

Either of these actions (there are probably other things they could do as well) would likely result in lower trust and usability on that chain, which might drive more users to the stronger chain.  This could create a spiral effect: poorer usability -&gt; lower price -&gt; less incentive to mine -&gt; reduced hashpower -&gt; slower blocks -&gt; poorer usability.

I believe that it is only in response to some sort of attack like this (that is, one that would cause existential risk to the chain), that a PoW change is seriously being considered atm."

"&gt; Marijuana is recreationally legal in many states in the United States. 

You're wrong, and instead of arguing, learn why. Some states have repealed laws banning recreational use of marijuana. However, federal law still bans recreational use of marijuana. SO even in Colorado, smoking weed is still illegal, because it is illegal at the federal level. All the legalization means is that Colorado law enforcement will not bust you for smoking weed, because the state no longer considers it a crime. It is still a federal crime. Therefore it is not legal anywhere in the US. Don't argue back, you're wrong, plain and simple. "
how?
"Not directly no. They're not monsters. However for many, especially evangelicals who follow a doctrine of pre-tribulation rapture, Dispensational theology, and Premillennialism will generally oppose basic world improvements or progress.

The reason is that they know that the world can only end at the specified point in time that God has established, and that it can only happen in the very specific way established in the Book of Revelations as viewed through the above theologies. So even if you could convince them that climate change is real and man made they really wouldn't care. Because its impossible that it could be all that catastrophic since the world doesn't end due to weather (aka: God will simply keep it from getting out of hand). Or it's part of the pieces that must fall into place for the End Times and therefore impossible to stop as it's predestined to happen.

It's this reasoning that also causes many within those groups to not like nations joining together (the UN or the EU for example) nations coming together sets the stage for the One World Government.

This is how they can shrug off melting glaciers, rising temperatures and massive flooding, but flip out about Transgenders in bathrooms. The climate stuff is just obviously impossible, while trans people could literally hasten the ""real"" end of time."

The problem with reducing it to 5 is it make the eelction less proportional.

What they ought to do, if they want to save money is have each STV constituency being 2 westminster ones, electing 6 members. total 9*6 = 54. Then have another 9 top-up members for proprtionality.

&gt; As a result, they knock a huge number of lightweight nodes off the network

I think you answered your own question here already. Such a group of miners would severely hurt Bitcoin as its distributed nature is under attack by their actions.  Miners hurt very much from this as their investment in personnel, equipment and power still need to be paid but the price of Bitcoin just went down...

Bottom line is that any attack you think of **is** an attack on Bitcoin. And miners feel that the strongest and thus is a scenario that is safeguarded by the basics of Bitcoin already.

Its like you asking what is stopping miners from 51% attacking the network for some small gain. Everyone should know **why** miners aren't doing that. Likewise everyone should know why miners are not going to create huge blocks."

"Hey! I'm a trans woman who's also a big tomboy! Trans-ness can come about by being premature (there are many other ways it is caused too but this is the one I know), since we all start as female in the womb, and in my case, since I was six weeks early, my body had changed to male but my brain was still programmed to expect female anatomy!  As a result, the dissonance of my brain insisting I'm meant to be some way (as my brain, so technically me, was designed for a female body), while my body shows no sign of being that way at all, can lead to a pretty strong dissonance that gets REALLY painful, distracting, and just plain shitty, leading to depression, isolation, self-hatred, etc!  Since my brain is female, and that is not going to change, what I CAN do is to change my body to be as close to how it should be as possible!  It can be hard- it never will be 100% how it's meant to be for me, and the time I spent living ""wrongly"" will never come back to me, but I do what I can and I've fixed my body enough to the point where I can feel like a normal person and live a normal, happy life now!

"&gt;However, I think you're undervaluing the political capital gained in some of these states (Texas, Alabama, Missouri) by just being vehemently anti-Obama.

Obama had [65% approval ratings](http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/gyketpy9ekeb23gpklo9bg.gif) when the ACA debate started.  Being anti-obama WASN'T valuable until after 6 months of ACA debate, and even then, ACA approval was consistently below that of Obama's approval.  State governors didn't decide to be anti-Obama, Obama created conditions where being against his legislation was popular.  "
"&gt; Demographic inversion can be avoided by ameliorated by immigration

Immigration causes much more problems than it solves. It increases crime, decreases societal trust and cohesion and stratifies society, both socially and economically. In addition people just plain don't want their countrymen to be replaced by foreigners. So it's neither an accepted nor a valid solution to demographic inversion, but rather another problem created by it.

&gt; If we encouraged too much fertility in teh developed world and it shot up to 2.5, would that worry you?

The fertility rate in the European Union as an example is 1.6. That's a long-ass way from 2.5. Also, in the unlikely event off overshooting 2.1 by some significant margin there is no difficulty in rolling back some of the incentives. The point is I think we should aim for replacement fertility rates, and for now that means greatly increasing the incentives for having children."
"Yeah I wish it was like that with my group. Our chemistry department was looking to update their entire systems.

Our it department told  us they wouldn't support any new hardware using those components because they were legacy. 

If we updated to current day connections it would be 10k+ for just the new pci cards and more for the updated software. Whole system upgrade would be over 50k. So right now we have legacy windows 2000 and xp machines running 100-150k hardware. "

&gt;Not once did I ever say that those who believe in sharia law want to harm the US 



Then why do you disagree with anything I've said?  Can you please describe the nature of your disagreement, because all of your arguments fall far short of that mark.

&gt;I only ever said that Sharia Law is incompatible with Western Society

Again, this has absolutely nothing to do with anything I've said.  Why does this constitute a disagreement?

&gt;This all started because of your ""Islamaphobia"" statement meant to discredit any fear or caution towards Islam as irrational 

When it comes to killing Muslims over this fear, it is indeed an irrational fear.  We are in a war on terror against Islamic extremists and we are killing them over their beliefs and practices, and if you insist on labeling all of Islam as extremist, then we got a huge problem."
"Nope, the idea that 'oily' skin needs the same thing for every single person despite some people having oily skin and hyperpigmentation, or oily skin and dehydration, or oily skin and literally anything else that makes someone's skin unique like ingredient triggers and preferences is the major difference between Western and AB skincare practices. The ability to customise and get the best products for your specific needs, whether they're AB or not, is the whole reason most of us are here. If you just want a set that claims to be for your skin, there's plenty of non-AB versions available where you don't have to research ingredients or figure out what makes your skin unique, but you likely won't hear about it on this sub.

ETA: And to address the other issue here, you should not be buying a 10 step skincare routine right away. The First Haul Guide is in the sidebar for this exact reason. When you're starting out, you need a cleanser to remove sunscreen, a low pH cleanser for your skin, a moisturiser, and sunscreen. 'Treating' problems can come later when you know that you can use certain ingredients and when you have these essential, basic building blocks in place. You should not be buying actives for acne, brightening products for acne scars etc. when you don't even have a sunscreen yet. Your beginner routine has *no reason* for costing $270, so remove all products from your wish list apart from those four products: oil cleanser, cleanser, moisturiser, sunscreen."

I suspect that some form of shorting would be expected however I am fairly/very inexperienced to how the market works. For example I tried to make money off trumps win last november but put my money into a USD short which was definitely the wrong option.

Currently I'm suspecting a strong hit on the Swedish general market (including housing but could see it extending) due to social pressures to increase spending alongside excessive borrowing and depleting savings under very low interest rates. 

Inb4 lack of knowledge and inexperienced kid - I know .. I'm learning .. but any help would be greatly appreciated"

"&gt;so far I've found 2 stocks that went up 50%+ the next day,

Good eye!  Thats great.  

&gt;but messed up in my ordering. first one was my fault (good for one day, but it was a holiday, and somehow I didn't calculate that right) the other one I put in my bid too low. The ask was too high, figured it might open closer to the previous close.

Yeah this will happen quite a bit unfortunately.  Just move on, no biggie.  Happens to all of us.

&gt;i'd love to know what happened with FSPM earlier this week. it started at $.04 or something, closed at $.0007, then shot back up to $.12 the next day

On the 27th there was a lawsuit about securities laws violations.  Investors sold, stock crashed.  Rebounded just fine the next day.  Apparently everyone bought low and no one was worried about the lawsuit at the price it was selling at.   If a stock is too low, buy it.  It will jump up because everyone else is buying it too.  Watch the trends and use the stop loss to limit losses.  "

"&gt; You still did not address the actual survey results from inmates who said they got guns from social contacts not private sales from unknown people.

yes i did and you're reading it wrong.  you're including the column ""Legal Even Under Stricter Standards"".  but you shouldn't include them because they are irrelevant to UBC.  we know a certain % of gun crime committers will have had a clean record when they bought the gun, and that UBC would have no way to prevent that sale.  this happens to be around 30% of the respondents overall, which while it flies in the face of the GG vs BG narrative, says nothing about UBC because there's no intersection with UBC.  

column two is the most important one for UBC.  that's the respondents who were prohibited at time of crime.  for this category, Street sales was slightly higher than F&amp;F.  

column three is also relevant tho less so.  that's the respondents who weren't prohibited, and still wouldn't be if all you did was pass UBC, but who would be by other types of stricter laws for what constitutes a prohibiting offense.  misdemeanor domestic is a good example of a class of offense on which states differ and it usually represents a sizable number of offenders.  although here, Street is only another 1% higher than F&amp;F relative to column two, so it's basically the same.  

another way to look at the results here is to compare the % obtained on the street for the first two columns.  C1, who were legal to own anywhere, only got their guns on the street 18% of the time.  C2, who were prohibited, were twice as likely to utilize street sale option at 35.3%.  what this indicates is exactly what we should expect.  ie, that a prohibited gun seeker would prefer an anonymous untraceable sale like an Armslist deal, to one where seller knew him well and could connect him to the gun he's not supposed to have.

"I've using the Neutrogena gelee milk cleanser for a few months now. It's super gentle and moisturising. I started using it as a AM/PM second cleanser, but it wasn't great for taking off an oil cleansing step, so now i just use it as an AM cleanser which it's perfect for. 

They say you don't have to wash off this formula, I mostly do out of habit, but the few times I've been lazy and not bothered it hasn't left a residue or broken me out etc.

TLDR: would highly recommend gelee milk for an AM cleanser"

"I have dry skin too and here's what I've found (after loads of trial and error) that works for me. 

1. To wash your face, start with hot water and a gentle scrubbing cleanser like Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Face Wash (the orange one) and exfoliate no more than three times a week, and only at night with a gentle exfoliator like Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix Scrub or anything by Dr. Brandt. Finish off with cold water to freeze pores.

2. Spritz your face with a facial spray morning and night after you've washed your face and before putting anything else on. (really any, but Mario Badescu Rose Water Spray is what I use, and it's really good)

3. Next, use a serum (literally any serum will do, they're like all the same) - right now I'm using a sample of Chanel Micro Serum Intense Replenishing Hydration and it's great.

4. Then, go in with your moisturizer. Here are some moisturizers that have taken care of my dry skin:

Mizon Snail Repair Perfect Cream
Korres Wild Rose Cream
Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream
Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Cream (has SPF, so I use this in the mornings and this brand is known for creating moisture in dry skin - sooo good!)

5. For primers, here are some good options:

Marc Jacobs Coconut Primer
Too Faced Hangover Primer
L'Oreal Paris Magic Lumi Primer

6. For foundations:

Laura Mercier Candleglow Soft Luminous Foundation
Make Up For Ever HD Foundation Stick
Chanel Perfection Lumiere Velvet Foundation
Milk Makeup Sunshine Skin Tint
Guerlain Baby Glow Sheer Foundation

7. After you've completed your makeup, skip powder and set with a finishing spray. I use E.L.F. Makeup Mist &amp; Set and think it's the BEST.

Try these out and let me know if it works! If you must use toner (most are incredibly drying for dry skin since they usually have alcohol), use Pixie Glow Tonic. I would also stay away from makeup wipes since they're usually not great for dry skin and instead use the Tarte Oil to help wipe your makeup off with water. Happy to help guide you further :)

"I think it mostly stems from stable isotope data from several systems (hydrogen and oxygen to name a few). 

As an example: a scientist can go out today and measure how much O16 and O18 is present in the ocean at different temperatures. The ratio of O16/O18 (among others) is dependent on temperature, and this ratio of stable isotopes to temperature is assumed to have remained constant through time. How would we generate more or less stable isotopes on the planet in a high enough concentration to alter that assumption???

In the rock (or ice) record, scientists can measure the stable isotope ratios  for different stable isotope systems and use them as a proxy for temperature.

"Since China reasserted its authority there, Tibet‚Äôs GDP has risen from 327 million yuan in 1965 to 92.08 billion yuan ($14.5 billion) in 2014, a 281-fold increase. See this report: Successful Practice of Regional Ethnic Autonomy. This year, 13 million tourists will spend $26 billion. Tibetans‚Äô life expectancy has tripled, indigenous Tibetans‚Äô population has doubled, their literacy has risen 6000%, maternal infant mortality has improved 400% and Tibetans can catch an affordable train‚Äìor fly‚Äìto anywhere in the world because their incomes have risen 700%.


ÔøºThere have been many ‚Äòhuman rights‚Äô accusations in Western media and one of the most serious is that the Chinese Government practices coercive family planning by imposing strict birth limits and forcing women to undergo abortions and sterilization .

"I have to say you're wrong on Souter pre-Supreme Court. While he certainly did not have the longest paper trail, he served on the New Hampshire Supreme Court for 7 years and a federal COA for several months. He may not have been the most conservative justice in the land, but his judicial philosophy largely pointed toward being a strict constructionist.

I'd encourage you to read his dissent in *IN RE ESTATE OF DIONNE* (https://casetext.com/case/in-re-estate-of-dionne-1#!). Here is an excerpt:

&gt;This conclusion follows virtually of necessity once we apply this court's clear rule that ""the language of the Constitution is to be understood in the sense in which it was used at the time of its adoption. We confirmed the vitality of this interpretive principle as recently as five years ago ... The court's interpretive task is therefore to determine the meaning of the article 14 language as it was understood when the framers proposed it and the people ratified it as part of the original constitutional text that took effect in June of 1784.

If that isn't an originalist view, I don't know what is."

"Im currently saving as much as I humanly can for a deposit for a house. Its slow going, but my line of thinking is: 

Firstly, going in with a reasonable deposit- your mortgage on a month by month basis is less (all be it, not vastly) than a rent. Well, at least that is true around here. I take on board the point Athiestmil made in that there is of course a hidden cost of ownership - but it does buy you some things money cant buy. Im talking about that sense of ownership, a bit of pride in something that is yours. You can personalise it and make it your own in a way that you cant a rented property. You have the security of knowing that its only your own solvency or choices that will determine how long you are there... ie you are not at the whim of a landlord! And then think, there will come a point 20-30 years up the line where you dont have anything to pay at all! Renting will have you in a lifelong cycle of paying somebody elses mortgage!

And think of it as an investment. Its most likely going to become your biggest most valuable asset and in life, having a large equity stake in something like that can come with its own challenges, but also its own security. 

Now I dont want to take away from renting and being a renter. Indeed that is my current status!  It comes with its own advantages particularly if you have a good relationship with your landlord. But I think if you were to break it down into pros and cons - buying would always comfortably win."

Thanks for your video response!

Why do you want the chain with most POW to add replay protection and change name to something else than bitcoin?

Maybe you should read up some more on BU. BU is not a Roger Ver project. It's an organization with around 50 members, and Roger became a member just recently. He's done a great job advocating it, because he understands that choking bitcoin at 3 tps is chasing users to altcoins and a huge setback for cryptocurrency as a whole.

The censorship is only in favor of Core. The ddos attacs are always on non-Core nodes, and non-Core websites. It's not a symetrical situation with blue team/red team.

You don't want bitcoin to split in two chains, as you said yourself. The miners, who have invested the most in this, don't want bitcoin to split either during an over due upgrade. That's why some of them want to make sure that a minority chain will not survive.

BU can't just ""fork off"" with a minority of hashpower. Because *BU is bitcoin*. BU follows Nakamoto Consensus, the most work chain. Bitcoin should not make a replay protection against a minority chain. The minority chain can try to protect themselves.

Please be open minded and try to understand that BU is bitcoin. :)"

Bitcoin no longer dies what it was supposed to do well. 

That so many people have moved the goalposts and who see it as a remittance network did Bitcoin a great disservice. 

The community is toxic and alts that you are so quick to demonise do everything bitcoin does and more but better. 

Sure, MySpace is still around. Still desperately switching from niche to niche. Bitcoin will always be around but the people who could have made bitcoin mainstream have all moved on. 

There has been literally no new use case for Bitcoin in half a decade. The use cases it served are dying or useless now. 

Down vote away. Fear of change has killed millions of software projects. Development paralysis and a terrible roadmap have spawned the alts that you use today. 

I'm not trying to convince anyone. I've never used BU. But Bitcoin is not dead, it will just fall slowly further and further behind. It's not fun, exciting, revolutionary or useful any longer and spending a day in an alt community really hits home how toxic the BTC world is. "

"&gt; whatever that means, is weasel words, as if the rule of law is a technicallity. They have had the same electoral process for 200 years, and all of a sudden it's unfair.

I said nothing about unfair, but to make this claim and call it ""weasel words"" implies that the perception is irrelevant. In democracies like ours and America's, the perception of legitimacy and the related perception of having a legitimate mandate are essential to govern, as evidenced by the struggles the Republicans are having even while controlling both legislatures and the executive.

I suggested it since it usually is a free way to get an accurate value on your house.  
 
The bank will want to hire their own appraiser so if you paid for an appraiser now to get an approximate value you'll pay again to your bank.  Zillow can. E accurate if all the houses were built around the same time and are in about the same condition.  Zillow is not accurate if homes are in a variety of conditions.  Check the recent sales they use, find ones that are about the same square footage and bedrooms/baths and get the $ per square foot.  Then multiply that by your square footage.  Does that get you to your required price?  I would look for about 75% loan to value based on your calculations.  That way if an appraiser is more conservative you can still get to your 80%.  If you are calculating right at 80% right now I would wait a bit."

Here is what was said

Sadiq Khan has said he believes **the threat** of terror attacks are ‚Äúpart and parcel of living in a big city‚Äù and encouraged Londoners to be vigilant to combat dangers.

The Mayor of London revealed he had a ‚Äúsleepless night‚Äù after the recent bombing in New York, and said major cities around the world ‚Äúhave got to be prepared for these sorts of things‚Äù to happen when people least expect them.

‚ÄúThat means being vigilant, having a police force that is in touch with communities, it means the security services being ready, but it also means exchanging ideas and best practice‚Äù, Mr Khan told the Evening Standard shortly before a meeting with New York mayor Bill de Blasio.


He was talking about the threat, and how you have to be vigilant.  And he was saying it in response to an attack in NYC.

You seem to be only talking about the existence (or non existence) of a Christian god.

As for your parents, I would not try to engage in a logic/rational debate. I don't think you will convince them of your position, nor should it be your objective.

"&gt; How would the core be icy at such incredible pressure

It's actually *because* of the pressure that ice can form, even at the incredibly high temperatures of Jupiter's core. Repost from when I answered this previously:

Ice as we know it on Earth is cold stuff. Lowering the temperature of water isn't the only way to make ice, though. You can also make ice if you raise the pressure *a lot*, although it has different crystal phases than what we're used to. 

Regular ice makes hexagonal crystals (that's why snowflakes are six-sided) and has a lower density than liquid water (that's why ice cubes float to the top of your drink). This phase of ice is known as Ice Ih, however, there are [at least 17 other phases of ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice#Phases) that we never really encounter in our day-to-day lives - they form under very specific temperatures and pressures. Some of these phases are denser than water so they would sink, some form cubic crystals, some are more like glass.

So the core of Jupiter probably has a lot of very hot, very high pressure ice. Also note that so far we've only just been talking about water ice. The core of Jupiter likely also has a good deal of exotic ammonia ice, exotic methane ice, etc."
"Agriculture is *currently* capital intensive, as agriculture is industrialised. In the agricultural societies of the past, that is a society whose political and economic institutions were based on the production and consumption of agricultural goods, agriculture was labour intensive. Thus practices like slavery, serfdom, demesnes, and so on.

Currently farmers ARE quite well educated. Forgetting that they all have 13 years of education like the rest of us to learn how to read and write and so on, unlike most humans for the majority of history, many owners of farms have specialised degrees in agricultural economics or agricultural science. Or they higher consultants and managers that do. Regardless, a lot of highly educated labour is involved in the running of farms. For instance, abattoirs do not set themselves up.

"Thanks for your considered reply to my question (which I see has been interpreted by some as trolling and worthy of downvotes). Your description of the relationship between corruption and politicians is especially acute. It makes me think that the ideal state of affairs - unbiased decisions about the economy - is a fond dream, enshrined in the Constitution, whereas the reality is this sordid pursuit of self-interest which was wittily described by Ambrose Bierce in his definition  'Pocket: the cradle of motive and the grave of conscience'.
However, it appears we have differing ideas about apples and oranges. Your dismissal of the Russian allegations as 'garbage' seems to prejudge the possibility that some could be true, which is surely a serious concern to people involved in Defence? There is, I seem to recall, a long-standing commitment on the part of the US government to uphold the Saudi regime, doubtless because of its oil, which overrides moral scruples, epitomized by the first Gulf War, when Saddam's invasion of Kuwait had the Saudi's so worried that they even allowed an infidel army to muster on their 'sacred land'.(Thus triggering Osama's revulsion).

"Title: PixelNet: Representation of the pixels, by the pixels, and for the pixels  

Authors: [Aayush Bansal](http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Bansal_A/0/1/0/all/0/1), [Xinlei Chen](http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Chen_X/0/1/0/all/0/1), [Bryan Russell](http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Russell_B/0/1/0/all/0/1), [Abhinav Gupta. Deva Ramanan](http://arxiv.org/find/cs/1/au:+Ramanan_A/0/1/0/all/0/1)  

&gt; Abstract: We explore design principles for general pixel-level prediction problems, from low-level edge detection to mid-level surface normal estimation to high-level semantic segmentation. Convolutional predictors, such as the fully-convolutional network (FCN), have achieved remarkable success by exploiting the spatial redundancy of neighboring pixels through convolutional processing. Though computationally efficient, we point out that such approaches are not statistically efficient during learning precisely because spatial redundancy limits the information learned from neighboring pixels. We demonstrate that stratified sampling of pixels allows one to (1) add diversity during batch updates, speeding up learning; (2) explore complex nonlinear predictors, improving accuracy; and (3) efficiently train state-of-the-art models tabula rasa (i.e., ""from scratch"") for diverse pixel-labeling tasks. Our single architecture produces state-of-the-art results for semantic segmentation on PASCAL-Context dataset, surface normal estimation on NYUDv2 depth dataset, and edge detection on BSDS.

5x salary tends to be a reasonable benchmark for calculators from what I can see, but bear in mind that when you actually try to get a mortgage, things like credit card debt, loans, dependents (i.e. children), and general month-to-month expenses could have a huge impact on that.

- I don't think NATO is looking to expand beyond the North Atlantic/European theater (eg, allies in the Pacific &amp; South America are not members, rather have separate alliance treaties)

- NATO doesn't admit new members with ongoing territorial disputes (Kashmir would be an issue)

- Presumably NATO wouldn't enter into a treaty like that with India without dramatic compromise re freedom of action/policy with Pakistan 

- Why would NATO want India to join?  Would immediately alienate Pakistan/Afghanistan.  Hard to see how contributes to Nato's core mission of defense of europe and potentially creates a wild card that could dilute the strength of the alliance by being drawn into a conflict where commitment is questionable.

- Why would India want to join NATO?  Non-aligned role lets it play between the West, Russia and China as it suits... and aligning then makes Pakistan a natural ally for someone else.  Could India ever truly rely on security assurances from Nato in a manner that would change their posture?"

"On twitter she loves going on about how ""woke"" she is all about ID politics while calling people Berniebros like we're all white frat boys. When people call her out for being racist and sexist for erasing a large percentage of Bernie's supporters she acts all holier than thou. 

She's even more insufferable on Twitter than she is in her articles, where she's been called out on appropriating other people's work on many occasions without ever acknowledging it. In any other era she would have been canned by her editors ages ago but because she genuflects to the corporatocracy she's protected.

I found out that calling her names and being mean to her lets her wallow in victimhood, which she loves. That's why I usually went after her terrible writing and her fauxfeminism.

"That's painting a pretty bleak picture. I've been to several of these ""no-go zones"" over the past year; Rinkeby, Tensta and Husby, off the top of my head. Heck, my student chapter had our spring ball in Husby last year.

These are areas with low socioeconomic status and where local criminal networks are considered to have a negative impact on the local community (Sources: [1](https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/Ovriga%20rapporter/Kriminella%20natverk%20med%20stor%20paverkan%20i%20lokalsamhallet%20Sekretesspr%2014.pdf), [2](https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%25C3%2596vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta%20omr%25C3%25A5den%20-%20sociala%20risker%20kollektiv%20f%25C3%25B6rm%25C3%25A5ga%20och%20o%25C3%25B6nskade%20h%25C3%25A4ndelser%20(2%29.pdf). As such, they tend* to be areas with high crime rates and a sense of unease in the population.

^(*I could probably get away with saying ""are"" here instead of ""tend to be"", but I haven't actually checked very closely, so I figured I'd try to soften this statement a bit.)

~~In some cases, the crime rates are really, *really* high. In Rinkeby, for example, there were about 19 700 reported crimes per 100 000 people in 2013 ([Source](https://www.bra.se/download/18.12caa4f91440b31239f3037/1396256033259/URBAN15_2014-03-31.pdf)), which is the second highest in Sweden.~~

This is of course a serious concern for residents and business-owners there, and I really don't want to downplay that, because we need to take this seriously. Furthermore, it should be said that as a white male, I'm not in the probably not in the most at-risk group, so how safe I feel shouldn't be taken as a solid indication of how safe these areas are. However, I do wish to clarify that these aren't war zones we're talking about; they're troubled, high-risk areas, and that's serious enough without embellishing on it.

**Edit:** Mixed up crime statistics for Rinkeby (19 700 reports / 100 000 residents) and Centrum &amp; √ñster in Landskrona (22 300 reports / 100 000 residents).

**Edit 2:** Decided to strikethrough my paragraph on Rinkeby crime statistics; some conversation below has convinced me that I was oversimplifying to the point of being misleading. Also added sources for the definition of these troubled areas (popularly called ""no-go zones"", although the police themselves don't use that terminology).

**Edit 3:** Changed ""gigantic concern"" to ""serious concern""; the previous wording was both a sweeping generalization (considering how diverse the 53 areas being discussed are) and rather an unfounded use of such an extreme word."

"As Americans, I think we are unfamiliar with situation where there is a *lack* of supply of something. Our economy is absurdly strong and we can important just about anything our hearts desire. So it is jarring to encounter a situation where supply is constrained and it drives up prices, as is the case with housing.

We are trained to smell bullshit whenever somebody talks about deregulating to help create supply, and rightfully so. Combine that with the threat of gentrification and how intimately housing impacts everyone's lives and we are guaranteed to be cautious when talking about ""supply-side"" housing. 

But this time, it's real. There are not enough Russian &amp; Chinese oligarchs in the world to consume an endless number of luxury condos and leave them empty. Sooner or later, people shopping for housing in NYC will start to have options, and with options comes competition. With competition, lower prices. Studios are probably the most vulnerable to price cuts, but the real question is what happens to larger units. Those are what families care about. The decline for units of all sizes could be precipitous, if construction was fueled by a speculative bubble. *If*."

"Health care is not a competitive market. That's certainly true. It has many of the determinants of market failure endemic throughout.

"Oil cleansing is awesome. So is hyaluronic acid serum. I LOVE it.  I also would not use the BHA daily. It will be too much. As counterintuitive as it sounds, keeping your skin hydrated and moisturized often helps with oil production and pore size. I personally wouldn't focus ALL products on pore size and sebum production for this reason.  Sometimes stripping all of your natural oil away will make you more oily.  In fact, I would keep an eye out for the wonder pore toner. It's quite high in alcohol which can dry you out.

I'm a big fan of buying things you can find locally. It's better in those cases you may run out, you can return in case you don't like it, and you don't have to deal with very long shipping times.

I'd keep the cleansers you have for now. You don't HAVE to use, an essence, serum and ampoule. There is no set number of steps you have to have or use. Most of us have VERY differing routines that contain anywhere from 4-12 steps. It depends more on what your skin wants and needs, not what some beauty blog told you.

I wouldn't add too many more products yet. Your routine is still new. I'd hang tight for awhile before adding in too much new stuff.

if i'm not allowed to talk about something that isn't the subject of the OP's submission, and i'm not allowed to ask how another user feels about a subject related to OP's submission, how am i supposed to further this dialogue? do you not see how this is completely ridiculous? what am i supposed to say? would

&gt;i think these attacks are politically motivated. we disagree about that. 

be the correct statement to make here? because that doesn't do ANYTHING to move this conversation forward

how about you just undelete my fucking comment and let me talk to another user so i can understand his perspective instead of being so concerned about how i used the word ""you"". i'm not allowed to talk about the political views of another user? in a politics sub? preposterous"

"Civilians die in war, and they'll die in this one too, whether by us, or by ISIS. The difference is ISIS intends to kill civilians for the sake of terrorism. We're actively fighting them to free the people under their rule. Sure, maybe we're also serving our interests in that region, but the point is that we avoid civilian casualties and apologize when we cause them. 

We don't burn people alive in cages on camera or saw people's heads off. We don't indiscriminately slaughter anyone we think might have collaborated with the enemy. The fact that you're even comparing the two is laughable."

Firstly the metabolic pathway that turns sucrose into fructose/glucose is bypassed.  So there is some potential for some regulatory mechanism to be missing.

Secondly the high in HFCs means that the natural 50/50 split is biased towards fructose.  Fructose has a very different metabolism than glucose.  The most relevant of which is that it is not an insulin secretagogue (and in fact inhibits insulin).  There are a number of potential effects of this, one of which it particularly insidious: mild diabetes-like symptoms including thirst.

"First: 
The universe hasn't always existed. That theory was disproven years ago. The general consensus today is that the universe (time, matter, and space) had a beginning. There are many evidences for this, which I won't get into here. Suffice to say:

‚ÄúAlmost everyone now believes that the universe, and time itself, had a beginning at the Big Bang.‚Äù ‚Äì Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose

Second:
Matter that has a beginning needs a cause (the Law of Causality). So the question hotly debated today is, ""What caused the universe?""
There are many theories about this, but the most widely accepted is the Standard Cosmological Model: the universe came into being from nothing, and the first cause of this universe was something outside the natural realm of space, time and matter. Not everyone agrees, however on what this first cause might be. 

Third:
The hot Big Bang singularity violates the first law of thermodynamics since the global energy needed to run the universe has come from nowhere and the principles of physics require that energy is neither created nor destroyed. Consequently, the hot Big Bang singularity fails. This leaves the cause of the universe unexplained by any force, field, power, potency, influence or instrumentality known to physics or humankind.

As such, the hot big bang singularity does not present a realistic physical concept because it cannot be accommodated by a physical theory. Therefore, it has been discarded."

Explanation: Just as the Moon goes through phases, Venus' visible sunlit hemisphere waxes and wanes. This composite of telescopic images illustrates the steady changes for the inner planet, seen in the west as the evening star, as Venus grows larger but narrows to a thin crescent from December 20, 2016 through March 10. Gliding along its interior orbit between Earth and Sun, Venus grows larger during that period because it is approaching planet Earth. Its crescent narrows, though, as Venus swings closer to our line-of-sight to the Sun. Closest to the Earth-Sun line but passing about 8 degrees north of the Sun on March 25, Venus will reach a (non-judgmental) inferior conjunction. Soon after, Venus will shine clearly above the eastern horizon in predawn skies as planet Earth's morning star. "

 I do wish you well, but I don't have high hopes for what most Americans will hear from you. The rallies will likely devolve into the typical hippie laundry list of every grievance imaginable. It's primarily a cultural thing, and those who don't identify with that culture won't listen.

The problem with many scientists is that you really think you're experts on everything in the world. You're not. There are actually professionals who specialize in communicating with people. I've seen some online, some on this very thread, and all of them say the same things. Sharpen your message.

"&gt; Full autos are prohibited for good reason.

I agree.  And that's a complete non-sequitur because the AR-15 sold in Canada is a semi-automatic rifle, not a full auto.

The other ""AR-15 like"" guns are hunting rifles.  In Canada, it's a long barreled, semi-automatic rifle with centre fire ammunition and a low-capacity magazine.  That describes hunting rifles.  I realize you're talking about putting a lot more legal restriction, (in the non-legal sense of that word) on a lot (possibly most) of those hunting rifles, but we should be aware that this isn't some group of non-hunting rifle.  You're describing hunting rifles.  And there are good reasons for using semi-auto when hunting.  If you wound an animal and it runs you should take a second shot and try to put it down rather than leaving it to die slowly in the woods.  (Track it down later if you miss and you can track it down.)

What makes the AR-15 stand out is the appearance.  It doesn't have a wood stock which people associate with modern military rifles rather than hunting.  But that obviously doesn't affect how or what it shoots.

Well that's what the mandatory course is for.

I've actually taken the course although I never bothered filling out the forms and acquiring the license because I don't own any guns and didn't plan on buying any.  I took the course because I was going to inherit a family rifle from the end of the 19th century.  It wasn't valuable, but it was a piece of family history and I didn't want to see it destroyed, so I needed a license.  But unfortunately it was destroyed in a fire after I took the course, but before I applied for a license.  

The course was quite in-depth and I wouldn't have been allowed to buy any gun until the RCMP had looked in to my paperwork.

But that is only one day of restriction. I'm willing to bet it has nothing to do with fasting, but more with not consuming a body mass maintaining calorie intake.

Smart contracts are difficult to implement verify, test and run in production.
They require programming knowledge, they require expert domain knowledge. Few people pose the skills and experience to write them. So it's not difficult to guess that there will be a very limited set of quality smart contracts that people will put their attention to. An average Joe doesn't care about these details, but will care if his funds ""tokens"" that were put into a contract suddenly disappear because of a bug or malicious intent of the contract creator.
It won't  be long until we see a contract that amasses the same interest as the DAO did, then if a flaw is exposed that puts user's funds at risk, a public outrage will happen again and will we see another split this time? Etherum Vanilla? Ethereum Deluxe? Ethereum OldSchool? For all I know a scenario like the DAO can be happening infinitely."

"&gt; Outsider looking in, a big problem is that it inhibits the emergence of rising stars to prominence 

This is really -- from a ""neutral"" standpoint -- the chief problem of the entire Clinton cabal's influence within the Democratic party in the aftermath of the 2008 Obama victory over her.

The Democratic party has suffered from, and allowed the Clintons to execute the [""Tall Poppy Syndrome/Strategy""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome) -- essentially subverting, corrupting or otherwise lopping off the heads of anyone that might be ""taller"" (younger, more accomplished, more appealing) than Hillary -- that's left the party a virtual ""desert"" in terms of leadership (or even ""alternatives"").

I cannot understand the reason for blocking today's solution because of this tiny difference. It keeps all options open to achieve ""segwit+bigger blocks"" later on, no door is closed by doing segwit only in a first step. A freeze of progress, as we see it now, is much worse.

I cannot understand why people who say ""I want A and B"", prefer ""neither A nor B"" (=status quo) over ""A now, B later"". This is just stubborn or politically motivated.

"DWS and other top officials of the DNC were forced to resign after breaking their own bylaws with their efforts to stack the deck in Clinton's favor.  You can remain willfully ignorant all you want, but this is an indisputable fact.  Also, remember that Sanders did better against Trump than Clinton in every poll all the way up until election day.  Even today Sanders is currently the most liked politician while Hillary's favorability rating remains abysmally low.  This is evidenced by Hillary failing to enthuse voters enough to beat a dumpster fire.  It's time to face reality, Clinton was a terrible candidate, people want more out of their representatives than just being marginally better than the Republicans.

Democrats need to grow up and face the reality of modern politics or else history will repeat itself and we'll have 4 more years of President Ronald McDonald.  You can't keep repeating the same mistakes and then blamimg everyone else when you fail.  Take some responsibility."

"&gt;Are you saying with SegWit that a block will be larger than 1mb? 

It is allowed to be up to 4MB, and with typical transaction usage, would be around 2.1MB.

&gt;If so then you don't understand SegWit. The total transactions recorded in the block will be larger than 1mb but the block will still have a max size of 1mb.

It sounds like you do not understand it.  SegWit blocks will be greater than 1MB (assuming they contain any SegWit tx and are full).  However, it is possible to construct a backwards compatible block for unupgraded nodes that is 1MB that they will accept.

&gt;Theoretically. The capacity increase depends on the type of transactions being recorded. All of the high estimates assume a high volume of large multisig transactions which give the most ""compression"". I would put the increase at 1.7 to 2.4 based on my research which is not enough.

I'm just basing it on current usage.  I would expect larger than that since when the price of something is lowered, you typically get more of it than before, so multi-sig now becomes cheaper.

&gt;Please elaborate. I'm trying to take you seriously but I just don't see how you can make the argument that increasing the block size DESTROYS BITCOIN. Would love to hear more...

I'm talking about BU, not a block size increase.  BU completely removes the ability of users to audit the blocks miners produce, and allows the majority of miners to create blocks that other miners cannot audit (thus drive them from the network).  It's a huge attack vector and an assault on what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin and not PayPal.

&gt;Increasing the block size is probably the simplest and easiest scaling option. It's practically 1 line of code. SegWit has quite a bit more risks and possible flaws that have not been uncovered as it is vastly more complex.

This is not what BU does.

And you simply cannot change that number - you will need to have every single user (at least every user you want to participate) do it at the same instant.  Otherwise you need some type of trigger or flag date, which is more complex.  And you need everyone else to upgrade to the same thing.

":) fair enough. We are all allowed to be partial to whatever pet be it hamster/cat/dog etc would suit our companionship, lifestyle and personality preferences.

I don't want a moody pet at the end of a long tiring day. I love sharing my life with an animal as responsively intelligent as dogs. Humans evolved dogs into what they are, very much in tune with us. My dogs unconditional enthusiastic love and affection nourishes me. 
The dog in the video was smart enough to realize that out of all those people in the camp this was the only man who fed him. This was a depleted suffering, starving stray dog. That little bit of food and affection meant something to him and he recognized that. He developed an immense liking, a trust, loyalty towards that man and his survival instincts kicked in, he persevered and followed him. He knew that man might look out for him feed him again. He was right. There was a thought process there. They're sweetly simple in their expectations but not simpletons. "

Honestly I prefer trump as he isn't a life long politician. What I like is he is unfiltered now think for a min here like I said he isn't a life long politician as such he doesn't have years and years of training to hold his opinion meaning agree with him or not what he said is his honest view. Do you think for a min other presidents are models of moral authority? Hell now look at Bill Clinton personally I find more offense in what he did while president then what the current one said well before becoming president not that what he said is right but the point stands other presidents have been and are just as bad as trump the difference is their experience of being a politician all their lives makes it easy to hide. If Trump had the experience and training of a normal politician and filtered what he said we would think nothing of what he has done it would be just another republican president doing what a Republican or Democrat president always does. No more no less trump hates comes from the fact he isn't hiding his beliefs as a normal D or R would.

"How important is it really to use a higher spf sunscreen?

Here's why I'm asking: for the last few years the only item in my routine was a lotion by Aveeno that's spf 15. And it works GREAT for me. The main reason I started looking into AB and other skincare options was due to an increase in hormonal acne last year (which I now have under control). However, I now have a lot of new acne scarring to deal with, so I was hoping to incorporate some actives into my routine to possibly help with that.

Here's the problem: I've been lurking around on this forum for a while, and I realize that a higher spf is important to use if you're going to use certain actives. So, I've TRIED adding a higher spf sunscreen to my routine, but the two that I've tried (Elta MD and Cosrx) have clogged my pores and given me terrible cystic acne. In fact, I think the Cosrx (which I've used longer) is responsible for the worst acne I've ever had in my life. I had assumed at the time that it was just my hormonal acne getting worse, or possibly another product I had started using -- so I meticulously restarted my routine from the basics and just this week added the Cosrx sun cream again. I haven't had any cystic acne in a long time, but the next day after using the Cosrx sun cream, my face was full of it. So, I think it's safe to say that the Cosrx isn't going to work for me. The Elta MD sunscreen resulted in a similar reaction last summer.

So basically, I'm 0/2 when it comes to adding higher spf sunscreens to my routine, and I've had terrible reactions to both. I know two products may not be a lot, but considering that they both have messed up my face so badly, I'm hesitant to try using another. Especially when I have another product with a lower spf that DOES work for me. 

So, is there any reason I should NOT start using an AHA if I'm only using spf 15 sunscreen? I've got a couple others I can try (by Canmake and Innisfree), but honestly, I'm kind of freaked out about sunscreens at this point and I just want my face to stop looking terrible. 

Thanks in advance if anyone has any advice!"

"&gt;I don't think there are any really. It's a decentralized, trustless network, and so it depends entirely on game theory. 

There most certainly are :-). Another example is you can only spend funds if you have the private key associated the public key inside of the script. This, by the current consensus rules, is an unalienable right. I would be pretty ticked off if this wasn't (I'm guessing you would be too). 

&gt;When the actions of a few threaten the actions of a large group, the economic incentive to drive that few away is greater than sitting idle.

Sure, but this does not apply to unalienable rights. Unalienable rights are there to specifically protect minorities against the whims of the majority. For instance, the majority may decide that the minority no longer *deserves* to own coins on their blockchain. If we didn't have the unalienable right I specified above they could very well do that and steal money from the minority. 

&gt;So basically there are no ""rights""

"I'm dubious of asserting causation from obesity if cardio-vascular fitness is not adjusted for. There's quite a bit of evidence that the association between obesity and lack of fitness may be the cause of the obesity associations.

This is important because, if you want to decrease disease risk, it's no good telling people to diet and lose weight if the issue is actually fitness. Getting fit is easier for many people than losing weight, and so it should be emphasised if it's the causal factor, over prioritising weight-loss."

"Religion has little to do with progress to be frank, just look at Africa/South East Asia, where you have similar communities embracing different faiths, but being Christian isn't going to make you tremendously wealthy over night. Many Christian parts of Indonesia are the poorest parts of Indonesia, and many of them have been Christian for 200 years, and its not because of discrimination.

If you were to group countries by religion, Muslim countries would most likely be in the middle in terms of human progress.   Behind Western Christianity, just behind Eastern Orthodox states, but ahead of Hindu majority and Theravada Buddhist states,  Just because people like you consider Islam the other prevents you from objectively from analyzing the problem.  None of the Theravada Buddhist states in South East Asia are democratic - Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar are dictatorships or semi-dictatorships. You group these countries as a whole, their per capita incomes are 1/2 of those of Indonesia , a Muslim majority country.  Of course Westerners make excuses, because the Thais have girlie bars, so that is progress right? You can even argue that their ""secularism"" made them more susceptible to the attractions of communism in the 1950-70s, which resulted in war, genocide and isolation

 Most Eastern Orthodox states without oil aren't that much better off than Muslims ones without oil. Serbia has a per capita income of about $4500, the same as Jordan.. Ukraine has a per capita income about 40% lower than Indonesia's now.  Russia even with all the oil is poorer than Turkey.

Overall comes down to institutions. If you look at the Middle East, Libya had just as much oil per capita as the Saudis, didn't have the religious diversity of Saudi Arabia (no Shites), yet its much poorer than Saudi Arabia. 'Secular"" dictatorship have a poor track record in the Middle East compared to the ""religious"" monarchies, particularly providing the stability for creating institutions. Saudi Arabia is corrupt, but its nothing compared to Egypt. My question for you is when are the Russian going to create a Dubai? 

The fact that the Arabs were able to produce a Dubai shows that Muslims can produce relatively clean and viable institutions. Even Russia with all its natural resources couldn't develop a bureaucracy 1/2 as clean as those in the Gulf States.

Compared to Western Europe, Islam blows.  But overall when you look at a broader picture.its average.

Being charged with lying to the government is actually a pretty common end result for federal investigations, since it's often easier to prove someone lied when you interrogated them than it is to prove they committed whatever crime you were originally investigating. That particular law doesn't apply to local/state police, but it would seem very odd for me for it to be illegal to lie to federal agents but a constitutional right to lie to state/local agents.

"If he is willing to have private meetings with men over dinner but not women, he's treating people differently based on sex. 

And if dinners are just for client relationships, then not only is he hurting himself by not building them with female professionals, but he is (again) being sexist towards women. 

Bottom line: if you treat people differently based on sex, you're being sexist. 

And that last hypothetical is not really analogous to Pence's situation. Pence isn't saying that he won't have private dinners with women because he feels unsafe (ie he doesn't fear that women will attack him), he fears that he will do something cheat with the woman presumably (or fears that everyone will assume he is somehow cheating). 

But let's say, Pence or a woman (like in your hypothetical) said they feared for their physical safety when having dinner with a member of the opposite sex alone. We (and the media) would have to assess the validity of that fear. 

It would be quite odd for Pence, who is bigger that most women and who is at a statistically low chance to ever be raped/assaulted by a woman, to fear being alone with a woman. Now if a woman feared being alone with a man, she would have statistics to show her gender predisposes her to being raped and/or assaulted by a man. 

But let's say it's a female VP who is worried about men assaulting her (to make the situation more analogous to Pence). I doubt she'd have any real reason for concern since she'd have the Secret Service somewhere near the meeting at all times. Also, most men, especially high powered government officials who are in the public eye, do not randomly rape or assault women at business dinners, so I think it would be a bit of a reach for her to assume this would happen. 

Is she being sexist? Maybe. However, I usually allow for kinds of sexism if they stem from legitimate reasons. Like if a man didn't want to be alone with women because he was raped by a woman, I would completely understand and respect that. But Pence doesn't want to be alone with women at dinners to protect his marriage or something? I don't see a reasonable rationale, thus I would conclude the behavior is sexist."

"I think the one thing I see here is that you are lacking in hydration. A hydrating toner with ceramides (I would recomend a Paula's Choice one) would help to begin to combat the dryness of your skin.

Additionally, the BP would not help the dryness at all so probably use that less frequently or more concentrated such as a spot treatment. 

I'm not sure about Glycolic Acid in the AM as it increases sensitivity to the sun. Also using BP and an acid everyday might be too much for your chin and could be working against the acne. 

I also see you aren't using an oil cleanser or first cleanser to thoroughly clear your sunscreen and makeup (if you wearing this too). Something to consider.

"The math made it clear to me at the sub $1 territory that it would have economic consequences in the long term.  I didnt know if there was a hole in the architecture at that point, no one was really 100% certain b/c critical mass hadnt been hit and 51% attacks were just a theory.  But it was solid enough to know for certain that it was vastly undervalued.  It solved a 1000 year old problem that impact vast swaths of the economy on a daily basis.  It was SOMETHING, even if what it was was still an uncertainty.

Edit:  the math also makes it clear it has a vast future beyond now, if still as uncertain as the early days from here to there as there to here."

"Sounds like you got in on the top-end of things considering recent movement, so that really leaves you with three options. Average down, cut losses, or hold into the audited fins whenever that happens to be. 

Are you confident in the company and can you afford more potential risk? Average down. 

Confident but not in a position to add more? Hold. 

Concerned it will continue to drop and audits are a ways away/never coming? Cut your losses. 

Pick your sentiment and act accordingly. 

The target most people are expecting is $0.02-$0.04 from what I've seen when/if fins drop. It'll depend on how much the revenue equates to for PixelMags.

"It's hard not to cheat on Wall Street when ... there's so much money at stake and it's so available.

This reminds me of when I bought my house, I apply for my mortgage at the same (parent) company of the listing Real Estate; by law the lending cannot talk with the broker; I told the broker that I was buying the house with 0% down and getting 2 mortgages one for the 20% down payment and one for the regular mtg with no PMI because I wanted to proceed till closing with just $500 down, instead I was putting 20% down payment in cash; I **had** to tell the mortgage originator who - by law - could not disclose that info to the broker. Of course they talked, and the broker kept asking me: are you sure you don't have any money? Are you sure you're not putting down anything?  I was LMAO (they were jerks, but I loved my house). At closing the broker was pissed and when he confronted me I told him that he was representing the seller, not me, we were not playing in the same team (we had ""issues"" during the transaction).

My point is that... things happen, whether they are legal or otherwise; the little investors like us don't have the upper hand, but we have our own advantages as well, we can be Ninjas, fast and subtle."

"Personally, I think it goes beyond just the comments he made last year. It stems from the fact that for a while he's always made comments that have bordered on outright offensive to Jews. An example being the time he likened a Jewish reporter to a Nazi concentration guard. Is Ken an anti-semite? Perhaps not. Is it insensitive to bring up the topic? Definitely. Is it appropriate or even necessary? Not in the slightest.

There was also the time he stated that Jews wouldn't vote for Labour ""Because they're rich"", which is a sweeping generalisation to make on a whole community of people. You wouldn't stereotype any other group like that, and it certainly isn't the case.

There has been a genuine worry amongst Jewish people that the party who once represented them, no longer does. That anti-semitism has been rising within the party and nothing is being done about it. It's being dismissed as an overreaction because in the eyes of Ken Livingstone, none of the comments he's made were offensive. Personally I think it's deeply insensitive. The real question is, should someone with such a prolific role in government be making these comments?

"&gt; What would cleansing entail, like using a face wash to exfoliate?

It depends on your skin really, and also if you wear makeup. If you do, you probably need to double cleanse (1 for removing makeup, 1 for cleaning everything up after). If not, you can probably just use 1. What do you clean/wash your face with currently?

In terms of exfoliation, again it depends. I personally can't do physical exfoliation because it's too harsh for me; but some people can get on with it just fine. You can do what's called 'chemical exfoliation' which is gentler and often way more effective. If you want to exfoliate, have a look in the sidebar over at /r/skincareaddiction for some recommendations. 


&gt; But if the oil persists, what type of product would I need to combat that?

I'm not too sure what products to recommend for combating oil since I've always leaned more towards dryness myself, but I think if the oil does persist it's a sign that something is a bit off balance, so you might need to try a different moisturiser, or combination of moisturisers. You could look for one that's specifically designed for people with oily skin - again, check out the recommendations in the sidebar either here or over at /r/skincareaddiction. 

You might not immediately find something perfect, but it gives you a starting point that helps you navigate products that are suitable for you better! Hope that helps, sorry I can't give more specific recs. :) "

"Since the stretch marks still look red and newish, as opposed to white, you should have more treatment options available now versus later. It might be worth researching a dermatologist, and I think there are now laser treatments that can help with the appearance of the marks though nothing will eliminate them.

"
"that's a goofy idea and i could find no scholarship to back it up.  no, the seeds of Prohibition had been sprouting perennially for decades.  the Temperance Movement went way back to the early 1800s and the Women's Suffrage movement to a large degree merged with the Prohibitionists and it proved to be a very effective coalition.  

another big factor was the tax structure.  in the second half of the 19th century, alcohol taxes accounted for an amazing 1/3 of federal revenues.  (imagine that today!)  but in just a few years the fed had basically replaced alcohol taxes (and then some) with the income tax.  

another reason was anti-German sentiment because of WWI.  all the brewers were Germans and cutting out beer-drinking took on a patriotic vibe.  and WWI itself was a factor because Pres Wilson probably wouldn't have supported it in DC but it would have split the party as the clouds of war were gathering.  so he supported it partly just out of political expediency that he probably wouldn't have cared about in better times.  

there was a lot going on in the years leading up to Prohibition, lots of political jockeying, lots of social change on the horizon.  you can't point to one ""cause"" of Prohibition, it was just a weird one-off thing that required a lot of things to all happen at once.  which is probly why it didn't last.  plus, people really like to drink booze and never stopped liking it.

For example, if they object to evolution/biology then pointing out prominent Christians that accept the findings of biology may help; [The Clergy Letter Project](http://www.theclergyletterproject.org/Christian_Clergy/ChrClergyLtr.htm), [PewResearch example](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/10/darwin-day/), specific people such as Francis Collins (NIH Director, Leader of the Human Genome Project) and Ken Miller (expert witness Kitzmiller v. Dover trial, ...).  Also, theologically, there's the concept of *theistic evolution* that basically says the sciences get it right ... and god injected souls in at some point differentiating our ancestors the animals from ***en***souled humans.

In the end, if you let other people speak for you ... don't be surprised if outsiders think they do speak for you.  For good or bad, that means you are responsible for that.

"&gt;The major components of DMS-base creams are:

"Absolutely. I agree with your points and thank you for sharing your experience. As you recognized, it's quite easy to transition from legitimate medical use to abuse (as you did with your leftover medication), which can easily lead to addiction.

About 75% of opiate addicts have full-time jobs and you wouldn't even know they had an addiction problem. People can manage their lives around it, but they are at risk of falling deeper into making their lives all about it, because life happens.

The patient satisfaction scores as a measure of healthcare quality and used in adjustment for medical compensation rates just blows my mind and feels completely inappropriate. Should Doctors be motivated to listen to their patients and care about treating the person, not the disease? Absolutely. Should patients have a say in how they are to be treated to maximize adherence and patient satisfaction? Sure.

However, it's also a total slap in the face of Doctors to allow patients to bully them around. Doctors don't get a decade of medical education and a lifetime of continuing education just to be overruled in medical decisions by a patient who wants something specific that goes against medical guidelines and treatment protocols. Patients bullying Doctors, and having their higherups with little to no medical education pushing the mentality of ""the customer is always right"" is a significant contributing factor to the issues of antibiotic resistance and the overprescription of opioids."

"Go online and read or listen to the book, *The Demon-Haunted World*.

Maria Popova, on the site *Brain Pickings*, distills Sagan's advice for using a ""baloney detection kit"".  

[Here it is:](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/03/baloney-detection-kit-carl-sagan/) 

&gt; 1.  Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the ‚Äúfacts.‚Äù

&gt; 2.  Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all points of view.

&gt; 3.  Arguments from authority carry little weight ‚Äî ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.

&gt; 4.  Spin more than one hypothesis. If there‚Äôs something to be explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be explained. Then think of tests by which you might systematically disprove each of the alternatives. What survives, the hypothesis that resists disproof in this Darwinian selection among ‚Äúmultiple working hypotheses,‚Äù has a much better chance of being the right answer than if you had simply run with the first idea that caught your fancy.

&gt; 5.  Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it‚Äôs yours. It‚Äôs only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask yourself why you like the idea. Compare it fairly with the alternatives. See if you can find reasons for rejecting it. If you don‚Äôt, others will.

&gt; 6. Quantify. If whatever it is you‚Äôre explaining has some measure, some numerical quantity attached to it, you‚Äôll be much better able to discriminate among competing hypotheses. What is vague and qualitative is open to many explanations. Of course there are truths to be sought in the many qualitative issues we are obliged to confront, but finding them is more challenging.

&gt; 7. If there‚Äôs a chain of argument, every link in the chain must work (including the premise) ‚Äî not just most of them.

&gt; 8. Occam‚Äôs Razor. This convenient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced with two hypotheses that explain the data equally well to choose the simpler.

&gt; 9.  Always ask whether the hypothesis can be, at least in principle, falsified. Propositions that are untestable, unfalsifiable are not worth much. Consider the grand idea that our Universe and everything in it is just an elementary particle ‚Äî an electron, say ‚Äî in a much bigger Cosmos. But if we can never acquire information from outside our Universe, is not the idea incapable of disproof? You must be able to check assertions out. Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and see if they get the same result."

"&gt;because ultimately all I care about is the money.

Well, if that's true then I wouldn't do this if I were you. Trust me on this: You will be spending lots of money without knowing if you will ever get a return on that. Entrepreneurship is not overnight success and it takes a lot of trial and error before you actually get something going.

Getting a degree is a good thing. You can fall back on it if your entrepreneurial dream ~~fails~~ gets procastinated. 

But you should seriously consider why you want to get into entrepreneurship. If you only aim for the money and freedom, there is a good chance you will never get there.

A lot of people don't get why people do this, that's why you are getting discourages comments. You should find people that DO understand what you want to do and be supportive. Local meetups, slack groups and conferences are great ways to find those kind of people and connect.

Try things, test things and do stuff. See what works and what doesn't. This is the only way you will get there."

"Higher dividend yields are generally for older people who are looking to retire. 

Although it is not a bad strategy it all depends on what your goals are. Some things to keep in mind dividends are get taxed as income and your $100 dividend will probably end up being $80. 

Most income stocks or high yielding stocks have substantially lower capital returns than growth stocks due to the nature of their dividend yields. What I mean is that if a company pays a lot in dividends chances are they have little to no more room for growth and are just paying investors the money they collect. For example VZ is one of the biggest phone carriers in the US. Guess what though, almost 97% of the US population is already signed up with a mobile carrier, so essentially there's is no growth for VZ to acquire more customers and grow their revenue, that's why VZ pays a nice dividend because they already pretty much absorbed all the customer available in the US and collecting money every month to be distributed to the shareholders.

Dividends are also paid as a portion of total net income from earnings. If a company is paying large dividends from their net income they are probably not investing into research and development and looking for things to grow. Take for example AAPL they only pay like 1-2% dividend and that's because majority of their earnings is put back into the business to invest in new technology and new phones.

But honestly it all depends on your investment strategy and what your goal is. Everyone has different goals. Investing in income stocks may help get some bills paid but probably won't make you rich. "
"OK. here is my serious advice for the OP.

Go get together about $200k of your own money (you must have that much if you had 3000% returns) and say it will be part of the fund.

you know, if you repeat what you say above to any medic *out* of a medical environment, they would totally agree with you. In a medical environment all they're thinking about is protecting their ass hence all the unnecessary tests. 

The criminal courts don't understand medical negligence and lots of good doctors have gone to prison because of missed diagnoses in this country... that's what happens in a litigious environment.

As for the long waits... God tell me about it. To make paper figures look good, management (completely non-medical people) over book clinics in ten minute slots, whereas in reality I need 20-30 mins per patient. That way they can cram 18 patients into a three hour session. Invariably one or two people have urgent or complex problems that require an hour to sort out. Add into that 5-10 mins per patient on a slow computer and unnecessary admin (again so we're not sued by ignoring trust protocols) and you're spending 120 mins on admin alone per three hour clinic! 

I'm really worried one of these days I'm going to miss something important in a patient and then end up jailed for manslaughter because a jury doesn't understand the nature of what we do. 

Sometimes it's easier just to order lots of tests and scan everyone and get them out of the door. Even though it can be detrimental for the patient, mentally and physically."

"&gt; The administration is going to have to show that a complete halt provides a significant benefit over current immigration policies.

And this is not true. 

You see, you are arguing for and against policy. You are quite allowed to have an opinion, and its reasonable to think that these policies might be too heavy handed. 

But that doesn't matter. You are arguing a political question.
 
This isn't an argument about whether or not his policy has significant benefits or not. 

This is an argument about *intent*.

It *doesn't matter* if this policy can't be shown to have significantly larger benefits than previous ones. 

That simply doesn't matter. 

This is because the court system only has authority to hear and decide a legal question, not a political question. Obviously their are caveats, but I don't see any of them applying here in this regar. 

Now, if it's shown that this policy won't have significantly larger benefits, and I doubt the veracity of such a clear result/claim being possible to portray, perhaps that could have some effect on arguments for intent. 

We can acknowledge that. 

But simply because one person thinks another way of doing things will work best, even if its shown that that person's way only has a few minor points stronger and is much heavier handed, that will not be enough. 

This is arguable, though, and this is the crux of the issue that will be decided by the courts and the evidence the Trump Admin provides. 


&gt;No one disagrees that there is an increased threat from those areas, which is why they have much, much stricter scrutiny on visas from those areas. The current EO is incredibly broad, banning entry but just to people residing in those unstable regions, but Nationals of those countries, no matter where they reside. Any other president may have been given the benefit of the doubt but Trump's previous displays of animus are going to haunt him on this one.

Yes, you can argue against policy all you like. You can state you think other ways would work better. 

But the courts do not have jurisdiction over political questions, caveats aside.

"I remember years ago doing a beta test on a new app that someone posted about in a programing forum.

I downloaded the iOS app and played with it.  It was kinda fun, but nothing I'd play very long.

I reported back that it was good clean and fun (or something like that).

Years later, the same kind of game became a hit.  Candy Crush.  The difference was the squares had candy, not just colors, the screens were MUCH more active than just plain buttons.  A basic 'connect four' type game.

The point is that the games have been done before.  It's hard to find the basis of a game that hasn't been done before, yet some people protect these things as if they were the first to find it.

I invented a partial solution to California's drought.  I researched it and it hasn't been done yet and it works.  The problem is how to go forward without it being taken away.  I used another product as an example.  Home soda machines.  One company has a patent on the process that make sit single stage, another does the same thing with two stages (steps).

It's basically a different way of adding the CO2 to a drink.  What they with one is patent the one-step process and another company did the same thing in two steps.

The point is that company 1 went out of their way to protect the idea/process.  It works as they have rights to something that is simple (one step vs two steps).

Clearly this was done to protect the idea and make money from it.

Point, some of these things are clearly people trying to make as much as they can from an idea.

I had a different approach with my idea.  I wanted to presell it to the point where I can get enough of a jump on the others that I can make a profit.

It's really hard to get from idea to profit, that's what most people don't understand.

I do software dev and talked a few years ago with someone that wouldn't say a word about his idea.  He played it up like it was going to change everything.  To this day, I still don't know if it was a game, utility or PDF reader...  He wasn't telling because he thought it was the ""million dollar idea""...  Given the fact that he never answered any questions directly, I doubt that he ever made a dime off it.

TL;DR;
Point: it's never the idea, it's the implementation of the idea.

This should have been proven when someone took a pile of rocks and sold them for millions by calling them a pet rock.

I dare (double dare) anyone to try and sell the idea of the Pet Rock today...

So AT&amp;T used this situation to claim the FTC had no jurisdiction in the case to avoid a possible bad outcome. But they still faced a future battle with the FCC about the same issue.

In that context, this statement: ""As a result, the the telcos could use this new protection to enact anti-consumer tactics like data throttling since they no longer had to follow the FTC regulations"" doesn't seem to follow from the sourced article.

"&gt; Let's Encrypt's ACME protocol is just one example. Virtually every other certificate authority (including free ones) let you upload a CSR in Base64 PEM form and you get a Certificate back out. You mention ""workable, standard certificate"" as if some CA's issue certificates in jpg or mp3 form.
&gt; [..]

When I say ""workable, standard certificate"", I mean to say getting a certificate at all that is usable in a wide range of use cases. Sure, you could create a self-signed certificate but that in general isn't workable, nor standard. Until you are granted the certificate blessed by the CA, you are completely at the mercy of the CA to do what it wants you to do, even moreso with free certificates where your choices are very limited. After all, you can't expect much for free when dealing with other people or organizations.

&gt; I never said free SAN certs from Let's Encrypt were the solution to everyone's problem. You mentioned them in your post as something CA's use to ""muddy the waters"". They're available for free so I don't see the issue with them being a thing.

That ""muddying of the waters"" comment is that the CA industry in general have so many different ""types"" of certificates when in fact they're artificial choices in order to have multiple cost tiers. Let's Encrypt is only encouraging this status quo to continue by only issuing the simplest of certificates ""for the little people"". Let's Encrypt isn't the source of the problem, but they're continuing it.

We're approaching a point in time where the prospect of unencrypted connectivity being blocked by default by browsers and other software is real. This will set the CA hierarchy into motion as gatekeepers of the Internet and its encryption. The fact we're not setting the bar much higher in what is to be considered ""basic"" before that point is scary.

Are we really wanting an Internet where only the most monied can innovate while everyone else is locked behind restrictions where they will need to do more to beg the CAs for the permission to expand or pay up?

&gt; I can understand why Let's Encrypt wouldn't use a Let's Encrypt certificate. It would create a circular dependency. If they run on their own product and there's ever a problem, it would cause problems for everyone. Similarly this is why CRL and AIA URLs are HTTP and not HTTPS.

Fair enough. Doesn't explain why the EFF couldn't use one though despite being a champion of it.

&gt; And again, you haven't really explained what a ""real"" certificate is and how it differs from Let's Encrypt. Let's Encrypt works e-x-a-c-t-l-y the same as any other X.509 certificate.

When I say ""real"" I mean one that has respectable parameters, isn't artificially limited to an insanely basic level and that could be used on a sizable website no problem. So far I haven't really seen a major website using Let's Encrypt. While their certificates are the same, the initiative feels more like an open source academic experiment for testing, than something for use in production.

&gt; Wildcards are generally not ideal. If one host gets compromised you have to replace the cert everywhere because they all share the same cert/key. Additionally a revocation will affect every single host using that certificate. Plus there's the risk of having the same private key spread across many hosts, thus increasing the chances it will be compromised.

True. However why are CAs there to ""save me from myself?"" If I can prove I own the whole domain namespace, there shouldn't be a barrier to obtaining that certificate and shouldn't be anyone but myself that says what legal things goes on with that domain name. Or if a client of mine owns it, it should be their policy that dictates their domain usage. Another party shouldn't dictate how one's namespace is used.

&gt; I understand the convenience of a wildcard cert as well as there being a market for them, and if Let's Encrypt offered them I would probably get one for my personal domains, but by not offering them that doesn't make Let's Encrypt a ""lesser"" CA any more than a CA not offering EV certs wouldn't be a lesser CA.

In some applications, it's not simply about convenience, it's a necessity. Imagine if you ran a site that sets up user subdomains at demand of your users. With say, Let's Encrypt you'll quickly burn through your weekly limits if you use individual certs for every subdomain and you'd need to go begging to Let's Encrypt to make you an exception. 

Likewise if you run an internal network infrastructure you don't want published to CT logs for an attacker to enumerate information about you, you also need a wildcard (e.g. *.corp.example.net). In a small business network that's properly set up, revocation is relatively simple.

Not every solution can be ""properly"" solved in every application with SAN certs or getting individual certificates for everything.

&gt; This logic makes no sense. I tell you EV certs are under $100/yr, and your counter argument is that not all EV certs are that cheap so that somehow invalidates the &lt; $100/yr price point? 
&gt; [...]

I'm arguing from the average, not from the cheapest of CAs. Supply/demand indicates since EV demand is low, cost will naturally be high. Without guides and support, people won't find those cheaper options.

The CA industry is practically a tourist trap.

&gt; You seem to be anti big-name CAs while at the same time being anti-Let's Encrypt free CA. I can't tell who you're for and who you're against.

On one hand we have the old guard that has allegiance to financial services and online shopping who are all about B2B, while on the other hand, we have the newcomers who are keeping the status quo.

I'm really ""for"" neither. The X.509 PKI was built in a day and age where only financial, ecommerce and big business services were to be  encrypted online. It's become bulky and cumbersome in today's day and age and threatens to become gatekeepers through red tape.

&gt; CA's charge for certificates because the infrastructure required to operate them is extremely costly.

We managed to reduce the cost of domain names and the maintenance of DNS, surely we could come up with a solution to CA costs as well.

If the DNS was run like X.509 PKI, few people would have an actual domain name to run diverse infrastructure on, most people would still on IP bare addresses while some may get a folder on their ISP's ""users.domain.tld/~username"" webspace, someone may have the cash to bribe someone to get a subdomain. Yes, I am saying it, X.509 PKI is operating in an outdated manner and is becoming a burden on the Internet, rather than an asset for identity verification.

There's a balance that needs to be achieved and it won't be at the current rate."

"Have you ever considered how illogical hell really is? I can understand the use of hell as a deterrent to keep people under control, but once you are put into hell, there is no redemption, no way out. So what is the point of a soul being in hell? Who does it benefit? It certainly doesn't benefit the soul that is in hell. Does your *eternal* torture benefit god? If it does, what does that say about the nature of god? If it doesn't benefit god in some way, then why does he keep you in hell? No benevolent god would do such a thing. Once you are actually dead, there is no logical reason for hell to exist.

No, the entire concept of hell makes no sense. Think about it - humans live ~90 years. These 90 years are supposedly used by god to make a ONE TIME judgement that sends you to either *eternal* bliss or *eternal* torture. Wait, wut? 90 years is NOTHING compared to *eternity*. Why does god bother with this test? Does god obtain some benefit from souls being in heaven? Religion says god wants every soul with him in heaven, right? Well, if that's true, then why bother with the 90 years of mortality? Why not just create souls directly in heaven? If god did that, there would be no need for sin, no need for judgement, no need for hell, no need for satan. Wouldn't that be far more efficient? This entire universe is a horribly inefficient system. Pretty shoddy work from what is supposed to be an omnipotent deity. I expect MUCH higher quality work from my deities.

However, the religious myths are EXACTLY what I would expect a bunch of ancient primitive humans to invent. That makes *perfect* sense.

Anyway, you sort of gave up the high ground when you said it was ok for the government to regulate your water supply and power company. If that's ok, then I don't see why other natural monopolies can't be regulated in the same way. Comcast knew there was a high probability of government regulation when they got into the business, telecommunications have been highly regulated since Reagan at least, so your precedent argument on utilities defends my point.

Also, Comcast will simply fail to provide the service if it isn't profitable for them. The free market always wins in that respect. If they want to exit the market because net neutrality costs too much they're welcome to, but they won't because they're exploiting a monopoly position and they provided it under Obama and made tons of money anyway.

"I would beg to differ with US vs China as China could (and probably would) conscript their entire population.  We purchase a lot of our military materials from China so all they have to do is stop exporting it to us and pump it back into their own military.  China is also rapidly expanding their military + they would be extremely had to invade with the ocean to the East and the Himalayas to the South-west.  US vs Russia would be a very easy and decisive win for the US if it was on our home turf, if we invaded Russia I feel like the outcome would be different based on how far they have gone in the past to win."
"No, it's not a first for a Supreme Court candidate.

In 1987 many groups opposing Reagan's nominee for the Court, Robert Bork, ran ads that opposed him.  The most famous ones were narrated by Gregory Peck (best known as Atticus Finch on ""To Kill a Mockingbird"").

That campaign was successful, or at least if that specific campaign wasn't the tipping point Bork's nomination was derailed and that seat ultimately went to Anthony Kennedy."

If you don't trust this to be true then you don't trust the entire foundation of bitcoin. You can't just swap some carrots for some sticks. Otherwise it all becomes sticks and then just falls apart. 

Maybe the problem is that certain Core devs decided that they weren't getting any carrots so they started to use the stick to take the miner's carrots."

"We put down $1000 in earnest money that's in one line.

The other line says we are going to give 68,000 as an additional deposit at the execution of the purchase and sale which is what our attorney said was highly unusual for our area. I had also read that 3-10% was typical The lender has seen this offer and didn't seem concerned but is still just sending us the gift form now as part of a packet of info today - hopefully we receive it soon! The purchase and sale was set about a week after the offer, which I'm now realizing is incredibly fast.

Total home price is about 350k

I'm just a little worried about the turnaround for everything and making sure we correctly get the cash from the in-laws by Thursday and wondering how our realtor should have structured the Offer differently so that it was more typical. Our realtor knows we are first time homebuyers but has done absolutely no coaching, explanation, etc.

We only even had our inspection 2 days ago - seems a little crazy to have to take all that info and be ready for a final purchase and sale by Thursday. 

Our lender is sending us a full info packet from their perspective which I hope arrives any minute."
"Impeachment of a US president by Congress is different than impeachment in general. A witness can be, and often is impeached for incompetence at their job during a trial. They are however just a witness, they are not going to go to prison for being incompetent. The impeachment is a lawyer arguing that they are incompetent and their word should not be trusted.

When talking about what someone who is not a US president or what the US president impeachment process should include, the broader meaning of the word should probably be used which is accusing them of anything they can be accused of."

"&gt; FPP actually benefits rural communities because their ridings tend to have fewer people than urban ones do, giving them outsized influence in Parliament

Stop right there. Representation in Parliament is much more dependent on the province your riding is in than whether your riding is rural or urban. PEI averages 27 235 electors per riding, Saskatchewan 53 500, Ontario 78 094, and Quebec 81 290 

Within a particular province the rural/urban disparity doesn't seem to exist. In Ontario the ridings with the largest numbers of electors are either smaller cities, or rural. Those with the fewest electors are either Northern Ontario ridings encompassing vast areas, or Toronto ridings which cover a relatively tiny area. This appears to hold true for Quebec, BC, and Alberta.

If you really want to rebalance your shit, pfe is poised for growth sometime in the next 6 months. Set a limit order for 37 or so. It'll hit it.

Hell, there are a bunch of biotech companies that are undervalued right now, but if you want to sit back and just let them grow slowly I'd go with jnj Abt or ABBV.

TSLA is also on a growth trend. When they actually announce the model 3 release date it'll see a big spike, and then after that release date is missed it will most likely crash. I'd personally sell it just before that release date, then you can see maximal gains. It might hit 279 or higher."

Get the people behind you in a populist wave and big, massive and sudden changes can and do happen in the country.  Obama bent over backwards to be the nice guy and compromise with the republicans.  They spat in his face and said no on pure spite.

Fight the good fight.  If you lose, so be it.  Bernie had widespread support.  Had he won, no question the Senate would have gone democratic.  Yeah, the house would still be republican control, but Bernie is a man of integrity and honesty.  His proposals would be very much against the established, entrenched interests and very much for the common person.  It would set the stage for a 2018 election and the democrats winning back the house and then his proposals would very much go through.

"The drug war exists because in the cold war the US destabilized south America into a collection of dictators who ran the economies into the ground.

All because they voted for someone the US didn't like, or wasn't on the CIA payroll.

These cartels sprang up and ran north to the money through Mexico until all of South America had cartels. Because we destroyed the economy and we had money.

In fact, all the hard drugs are all coming from down south, south of Mexico from places like Columbia.

Funny enough, I don't remember cartels existing back before the Cold War. Because until the Dirty War happened, there was no Cartels. There were Caudillos, but no cartels.

So no, our drug laws didn't create the cartels. We always had the same drug laws and in the ""good old days"" there were no cartels and drugs were still illegal.

Cartels thrive on wrecked economies. They don't give a shit about Mexico because the drug suppliers aren't even Mexican in the first place and bad economies give them more power and in turn make our gang problem worse.

[And according to the FBI, American gangs have been infiltrating the US military. We cannot afford to give them more power.](https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/2011-national-gang-threat-assessment)

"You'd have a good point, if any of what you said actually happens in the real world. While that argument is fairly logical, it just doesn't happen like that. Raising the minimum wage in Seattle [did not affect prices](http://www.washington.edu/news/2016/04/18/early-analysis-of-seattles-15-wage-law-effect-on-prices-minimal-one-year-after-implementation/), [did not affect job growth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2017/01/07/seattle-restaurant-jobs-keep-growing-with-higher-minimum-wages-after-a-year/#50a5ae253579), and [in CA, the raise actually increased profits for a prominent fast food restaurant](https://ww2.kqed.org/news/2017/01/03/minimum-wage-goes-up-and-so-does-business-thats-what-this-fast-food-ceo-says-happened/). 

The fact is, that people at minimum wage can affect the economy too, and the wage increase bolsters the bottom end, allowing them to spend more and improve things in the area, not cause a dramatic price shift, because prices are set by people with money, not at minimum wage.

They just decited to bailout icelanders that had money in those banks and not foreigners that put money in the banks in hope for insanely high interest rates. Icelanders had no choice, but EU wanted them to bail out everyone or completely bankrup the country because EEU doesn't allow countries to handle foreigners in a different way then it's citizens. But Icelandic government didn't agree with that law since the whole banking system collapsed. They were sued and the Icelandic goverments won so they were right.

The econome has bounced back and the Icelandic krona is back to what it was before the economy collapse. The capital controll was lifted just few days ago.

"Subscriber numbers are either growing or shrinking. Shrinking is no good, since eventually shrinking subs become five people talking amongst themselves. So growth is the only real choice for a healthy subreddit. But for a sub like this, especially, you want a steady trickle of growth, to supply fresh voices and new perspectives. For example, I see more and more Korean thought around Reddit. It would be appropriate to bring some of that thought here, since we may as well think outside the US box. Growth will bring that. Growth will make up for, say, 100 subscribers all deciding they don't have time for Reddit any more. 

Most importantly, if your subreddit has merit, it must then  follow that others will hear about it and come see what's up. Otherwise your core idea is not strong. So, again, you would want to see some growth to know that your subreddit is on the right track, and is relevant.

It's a choice between growth and none, growth pretty much wins. You just don't want the entire shitpile barging in here and doing what they always do, which is ruin the fun. Whatever fun is around here."

And the easy, lazy way out to respond is, ""Yes, but the north is racist too!"" 

It may not be meant as one, but it's a fucking _dodge_. It is the 'hey, look over there' of internet arguments, and it happens all the time.

Too many times the people of the North have liked to pretend that they were not racist unlike their fellows in the South. But segregation was legal in the South in my lifetime.  There were Jim Crow laws in the North but far, far more in the South.  

The North needs to deal with its racism, but they were in no way ""just as racist"" because the entire structure of Southern state governance and society was built around segregation for a hundred fucking years after the Civil War.

- relating to a system of government that is centralized and dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state.

The US military is heirarchal.  With myriad legal limitations, responsibilities, codes of conduct, and individual discretions.

&gt;edit - the ***ONLY*** limit to military power in this country is the constitution, and you have to ask yourself if it really is a limit if the military is the only entity enforcing it.  

That's a silly absolute contention.  The limits to the use of that power is a civil society.

&gt;Again, the Founders knew all this, they absolutely did not want a standing army in the country if it could be helped.

Well, the US is the world's army now, so we'll not be shitting backwards there.

&gt;and the polls I've cited show rampant Islamophobia in the GOP presently.

In the world, actually.  But your camparison is still ridiculous.  ~40% of a population supporting genocide isn't even remotely close to anywhere approaching what's happening today.  That's a subjective opinion though.  If you want to believe they are the same thing, fine.

&gt;To put it succinctly, your data is not relevant to the situation today...it makes an inaccurate comparison.

lol that's fucking rich, right there!  After all the complete bullshit nonsense you threw against the wall?! Hahahahaha...Were fucking done, bro!

A coup in the US is a ridiculous notion.

"You are very much over simplifying the problem. This post is about universities, while you are talking about school performance.

Let's talk about the school performance. Say I had a class where 10 students were underperforming. I would absolutely help all 10 regardless of gender, race, sexuality. However if the school finds out that one average boys perform worst than girls then we need to talk about what we do to address that next year.

Those discussions do not take the form of ""help the boys, ignore the girls"" but rather ""how can we engage our boys better? The girls are already engaged""

Now if I implement something and in my new class next year I only have 4 students underperforming, 2 are boys and 2 are girls then I am not going to ignore the girls because we discussed raising boys' engagement at the start of the year."

"I see the IFNAR -/- like taking guns away from the military and then studying how well the military does against an adversary. Now, I'm fairly sure the military would scale up some of their other weaponry and defenses to compensate for having no guns. But not having guns changes what and how you can defend regions and/or go on the offensive. 

In the same way, studying how a virus infects a host in the absence of IFN-signaling needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I'd argue IFNAR -/- mice would work as well as WT if we are looking at neutralizing antibodies or other therapeutics, because you are just using the mouse model as a sensitized proxy to determine how functional the virus is. But in terms of mechanistic insight, I think this kind of data becomes much more convincing when combined with IFNAR -/- independent data; whether it is from cells, animal models, or epidemiological data."

I would argue we may be getting *further* from totalitarianism under Trump, in that thus far he seems to *giving up* more power than he is taking.  Aside from military spending (protecting the country/securing the borders is *at least* the Federal government's  job), he seems to be taking action to severely limit the Federal government's influence and power in other areas and downsizing many Executive Branch agencies. 

We can argue over these actions (particularly when it relates to budget issues and what the Fed government's priorities should be), but it's hard to deny that these are *not* the actions of government moving toward totalitarianism.

We don't live in a Hollywood movie where a President becomes a dictator simply by installing a police state.  The U.S. has too many moving parts, and a would-be dictator needs far-reaching control over nearly every aspect of American life to be successful for more than a few hours.

&gt; TSA is now allowed to demand passwords from travellers.

Law enforcement is allowed (without a warrant) to demand all sorts of invasions of your privacy depending on the circumstances of their inquiry.  The TSA is not permitted to come to your house and make this demand, only during a voluntary inspection that you submit to if you want to board a plane.

&gt; people are still being detained, attacked, and have their laptops and whatnot destroyed for no reason.

The TSA agents are aware prior to taking this action that the person is innocent of their suspicions?  I agree that these instances should not happen at all.

&gt; Trump administration is slashing budgets for the arts.

And after seeing viral memes of Nazi book burnings you've concluded this is some kind of ""first step""?  The difference is that Nazi's weren't burning state-funded art and media, only the media they did not/could not control.  

&gt; Laws protecting LGBT individuals are being cut away as well.

I assume you're referring to the administration pulling Obama's executive 'guidance' on transgender bathrooms in schools.  This ""protection"" was not 'cut' as it was not in effect (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/us/transgender-bathroom-access-guidelines-blocked-by-judge.html?_r=0).  The Federal government's policies in these cases has actually not changed.

&gt; How scared, realistically, should we be right now?

The ultimate fear should only be that Trump will be a shitty President, tank the economy and ruin our standing in the world, and leave a huge mess for his successor.  This is when you get fearful about dictatorship, *these* are the conditions under which they spring up.  "

"Who is ""they""?"
"I have been managing paid search for 8+ years. Most Google support specialists can barely answer regular questions about the system, 99.9% won't have a clue about strategy and tactics.

Regular Adwords is definitely better than Express, it gives you more control and transparency.

The first thing I would do is make sure your groups are very tightly themed. Use small budgets (that's relative depending on your overall budget and industry you are in). You may even want to pause the until you have this in place.

What I mean by tight themed ad groups is if you are a hotel in Las Vegas make sure you separate these keywords into different groups:

las vegas hotel  
las vegas hotel casino  
las vegas casino  

But keywords like this would be in the same group:

las vegas hotel  
las vegas hotels  
hotels in las vegas  
hotel in vegas  
etc

You do this so you can write ads highly relevant to the theme of that group, making it more likely to get the click.

Make sure the keywords are not traditional broad match. There is nothing wrong with experimenting with traditional broad match, but since you don't have experience, I would stay away at the beginning because it can eat your budget quickly. Exact, phrase, and modified broad match are all fine. Though, as you are learning you can always start conservative, with exact match, then expand as you get more comfortable.

Another thing, negative keywords (someone else mentioned it as well) are your best friends if you are using anything other than exact match. Get a healthy list of keywords that might trigger your ad that are not relevant or you don't want to trigger your ad. Using the Las Vegas Hotel example:

If you are bidding on ""las vegas hotel"" as a phrase match, it would also match to ""las vegas hotel jobs"". You could add ""jobs"" and ""job"" as negatives to keep it from showing. Don't add the full keyword as it will only negate it if they type all those words in. Another example where it might be completely irrelevant, ""hotels in las vegas nm"" (there is a Las Vegas, New Mexico). You could add ""nm"" and ""mexico"" as negatives.

So think hard about what you are bidding on and what other irrelevant terms may be searched with along side those terms. You can use keyword planner and a tool like https://ubersuggest.io/ to pull from Google's suggest tool. Weed through the results looking for any irrelevant phrases. 

Also, from the data you have already collected, look in your search term report (from keyword tab). It will show you keywords people have used to trigger your ads. Many may be in the ""other"" row, which is another good reason to use those tools above.

Lastly, make sure you add any and all ad extensions that are applicable to your business.

This is by no means exhaustive and really just getting started, but it will get you moving in the right direction.

Best of luck."

"I'll keep posting it until you understand it.  None of you fn numpties even know what ChinaBU does.

Emergent consensus lets miners decide, through force of hash, the block size. This provides for them an incentive such that, as they increase the block-size, it leads to the nodes not being able to be run except with massive connections to the other nodes and miners. The miners that are closer (in bandwidth) to the other nodes, will have more time to retrieve the transaction and block data. Nodes and miners on slower connections will further deplete, as they can't source the data fast enough. This will also mean that communication between miners will favor miners that are closer together.

This means, by design, bitmain will be able to force ALL miners and ALL nodes off of the network, and every node and every miner will be housed in bitmain data-centers.

You numpties are cheering for china-coin."

I actually don't think all gender roles are bad. I think that it becomes an issue when people try to force people to conform to those roles. You can believe that a man should be the provider for the family and a women should be a caretaker for the family and if that makes both people happy in this scenario then more power to you. I think it's bad when people try to tell others that if they want to stay at home or work instead of having kids that their wrong becuase that's not what their gender is supposed to do.

"It looks like your comment is ghosted.  Ghosting is normally automated and from Reddit itself.

The most common cause of ghosting is voting/commenting on your own post/comment with an alternate account.  Under this scenario, your account would be ghosted automatically at a certain threshold regardless of what subreddit you are in and even if it is in multiple subreddits.

I'm not saying you did that, just giving an example scenario and showing how it would be automatically ghosted without moderator intervention.

Now, with that said, it's also possible a moderator muted you for a post that was questionable, but I kinda doubt that.  As a moderator, in a busy subreddit, it's not an easy tool to use.  That is, you can't just click on the username and a mute button appears.  If I'm working down a long thread of comments, I'd much rather just delete and move to the next spammy comment.

If a mod did mute you, I would have to add, that reviewing your account history at a glance, it does kinda look like someone trying to build up account history for a spam account.  It would be an easy mistake for a mod to make when they are just reviewing your account at a glance.

With all that said, just message a mod and ask if you've been muted.

Good luck :)"

"Again, though, these are comments about Christianity, not Jesus. Christianity was absolutely a thing, but this doesn't do much for the historicity of Jesus himself.

And the purpose of bringing up Paul's vision is that I don't think he's qualified to make off-the-cuff comments of any value about Jesus.

Do you think it would have been easier to convince the general public and policy-makers to respond to Zika if it caused  symptoms in a greater percentage of people infected, even if the symptoms were typically mild? Is there anything we can learn from the management of other health risks that may seem insignificant to the individual in the short term but pose a public threat (e.g. nicotine products) that can help organizations like the WHO to develop better messaging strategies to bring disease perception into alignment with disease reality?"

Radicals indeed perform an important function in helping to make the range of possibilities more visible to the general population, but suggesting that reform is not possible without revolution seems rather silly (and counter-productive as well, unless you're advocating putting off *all* reform until things get so bad that a revolution becomes inevitable - not a position most Americans would likely support).

Using the ACA as an example of reform suggests that you really don't have a clue about how politics functions here.  I'm not sure you have much more of a clue about Bernie, who plays his cards rather close to his vest while negotiating the highly sub-optimal environment in which he needs to function."

"This is so sad. Last night, I decided to dip into Hayek's The Consitution of Liberty. I decided to read Part I Eight: Employment and Independence, because I didn't have a distinct memory of reading it back in university.

In that section he says that when wage earners become a majority in society, not being familiar with the dilemmas faced by independents, they makes laws to their own benefit, and that this becomes more pronounced when government employees become become the majority of wage earners.

This seems like an example. You want to reward good work. Employees want a personal life that's insulated from their work life. Both desires are completely understandable.

If we let the Adminstrative State expand, the incentives will only get more perverse, not because of evil intent, but because of a lack of familiarity with the dilemmas facing business owners."

"If, when you talk about being at the helm, you mean being the public face of the company rather than just the head, I think there's a bit more to consider, and some of it depends on your chosen route to market. It sounds as though you bring a lot of business savvy, but in this field it isn't really enough to be well versed in nutrition and exercise - bringing in someone coming from those backgrounds with appropriate qualifications (issue of gender aside) adds a lot more clout that will help with positioning and publicity later down the line - that is, if you decide to put a public face to the company. To be blunt, not so long ago, no legacy media would go near you if you were trying to take a leadership position in a field you weren't qualified for - but if you become a sensation thanks to social media etc, they may cover you then. Other than that, there have been quite a few fitness movements with men at the helm that are mostly targeted at and populated by women. But if you lack the requisite charisma, you don't have to make this a personality brand. Irkitect makes a good point about the need to delve into specialist knowledge. I once saw a dancer who had had a baby pushed to the point that she wet herself in class by a young male teacher who wouldn't listen when she was trying to explain that her body wasn't up to his demands. Stoicbizman also makes a good point about consulting your target group. These days, you can reduce risk by developing products and services in consultation with your potential customers, rather than just launching something and hoping people like it. There are lots of existing mum's networks out there. Expect to have to pay one way or another to involve potential customers in your research as you refine your offering (sweepstake prizes for completion of surveys pushed via Facebook, or cash for participation in focus groups), but it may save you even more money later down the line.

"&gt;Yes it does. It invalidates liberal ideology, ergo freedom of speech is not this great unalienable right.

I disagree. Something being true does not mean its assertions on what ought must be followed. If I regarded Christianity as true, I'd still not be a Christian. I'd have to be convinced that it was a moral philosophy.

&gt;Even in the UK today we don't have 'true' free speech (look at libel laws, the Official Secrets Act or threatening speech, all of which are grounds for legal action).

Indeed, and much of that is to our discredit. There's no reason to extend our failings and lock people up for mocking your religion.

&gt;For example, single motherhood. If someone said that the best conditions for bringing up a child is in a home with a father and a mother then they would probably find strong resistance against that point by people who would say that single motherhood is brave, a hard job etc (which of course it is), and that it works for the woman and child involved. But that defence has no bearing on the point in contention.

I would say that single motherhood is often not ideal, but nonetheless, it should not be illegal.

&gt;Except we have laws, which necessarily decide things for us. You've fallen at the first hurdle.

You've ignored the context of that comment. Laws are designed to stop people from hurting others. That's their literal purpose. We can do as we will, providing our will does not impose on the ability of someone else to do the same.

&gt;Not sure what Scripture in particular has to do with this. I've already established that governments don't give unlimited right to free speech. It's obvious that at times speech can be just as harmful as direct physical action, something liberals refuse to accept.

I am pretty certain you're using ""Liberal"" and ""Progressive"" interchangeably at this point, because many modern progressives would very much object to Liberals thoughts on freedom of expression. Your understanding of mainstream left-wing thought is laughably outdated.

In any case, the point is you think your religious values ought to dictate the course of my life.

&gt;Neither do I.

In some cases, you do. Unless you invoke another reason to criminalise them.

&gt;Yep, that's the negative freedom ideal, which ignores the pursuit of the moral life.

Whose moral life? Yours? Mine? Whose pursuits do we follow? Why? I object to much of what you regard as moral. You want the state to impose a ""moral life"" on its population as the norm?

&gt;I think I do.

No you don't. Moral relativism is when you say ""When in Rome, do as the Romans."" It's the excuse given for why we should scrutinise countries for having contemptible human rights records. I do not say that, and criticise regardless. I am the utter opposite of a moral relativist.

You don't understand moral relativism, and nor do you have any meaningful grasp on Liberalism.

And the fees might be $0.20 at the moment (haven't looked), they sometimes jump up over a dollar. 

And it's not that I expect core devs to care about my specific business, it's that there used to be such a large push years ago trying to get businesses to accept Bitcoin to help the ecosystem develop. There was a lot of people who felt that Bitcoin won't 'make it' until there are Bitcoin-only businesses. 

When Core decided to pivot to a ""settlement layer"" approach where regular transactions take place on secondary layers, they should have advised the regular users and business users on what to do since they're apparently not the focus anymore. 

I'm glad Core has been working hard on SegWit, but they've seemingly abandoned or discouraged existing business uses from using Bitcoin without suggesting an alternative until Lightning Networks (where they want all business transactions to take place) are ready and functional. 

It's been years and it'll likely be years more until we have a healthy functional LN ecosystem. Businesses are fleeing Bitcoin as a payment solution and I'm shocked that the Core developers haven't issued an official recommendation on what to do until LN is operational. At this point, we're not just losing all Bitcoin acceptance momentum, it's moving backwards.

"The only safe behavior, IMHO -- for any wallet app -- should be to print a warning ""hard fork detected - investigate and upgrade as appropriate"" and shut down.  

The user then would have to check what hardfork was that, and decide which side he wants to use.  In either case he should download a new version of the wallet that accepts the desired branch and ignores the other one.

In fact, he may want to download both versions, using separate copies of the wallet files, in order to get whatever value remains in the coins that he has on on the undesired branch."

"Seconding this, I have a good friend that is going towards a doctorate in assessment and testing which covers tests like this literacy test.  I ran the article by her for confirmation, and long and short of it; test questions can in fact be racist.  It would take going through these tests question by question to identify the racist questions, but chances are the large demographic variance is an indicator that some of the questions are much harder for black and hispanic people than caucasians, and it has nothing to do with how literate they are or how difficult the question is.  Some of the questions have accidental cultural norms sometimes, especially for longer or more intricate test questions like you'd see on a literacy and reading comprehension test, that make it more difficult for certain groups to the point where it seems racist.  Put enough of those questions into a test, and the whole test seems racist.

That being said, I'd have to see some sources other than this article, but ideally what's happening is that the company who writes this test for New York is taking it back and rewriting it after identifying the problem questions, so that when it comes back it will be more representative of actual literacy instead of cultural knowledge, which is usually the key problem if a test is being labeled 'racist' and you have big racial gaps in passing rates.  If its just being scrapped wholesale with no immediate replacement... then yeah, we can laugh about it pretty safely.

TL;DR: Tests can in fact be racist."

"As far as I understand Jihan partly owns bitmain which provides 70% of the mining hardware (don't have a source on that) out there (Antminers). Antiminers seem to be the best product to mine bitcoin on the market (best meaning higher hashpower for the same or smaller electricity consumption as other mining hardware).

In themselves antminers are not locked to a specific pool or bitcoin implementation so anybody could buy it and use it and mine bitcoin core (which lots of people did and do). However large miners are reliant on getting deals with bitmain in order to get cheaper hardware and have a more profitable business. Those deal can be seen as sort of a preferential treatment and Jihan has the power to decide who gets or doesn't get the deal (or how much the deal is worth). So if you're a large miner or a large pool oeprator and want some hardware, you have to play ball with Jihan.

Please anyone correct me if i'm wrong."

The 96 Essence is watery and layers REALLY well over toners and under creams. The 92 Cream has a bit of a thick, greasy feel...enough to make my skin's surface feel a bit gunky before layering other things...but it's not really moisturizing so if I leave it as my last layer or decide to put less cream on top, my skin gets drier.

I think both are soothing- probably on the same level. But the 92 Cream offers no extra utility to me AND it's harder to fit in a routine for me."

"It's about ideas.

Right now, corporate Dems are preaching what?

RESIST TRUMP!

Fine idea right?

Well, resist for what exactly?  Notice how they don't talk about that part much?  They don't talk about it, because they have nothing to offer economically.

We are at a crisis point now.  Have been for a while.  There are class level economic problems in play and they really matter.  When a majority is hurting, they are going to go for the answers, whoever gives them.

Trump did.  And so here we are.

Now, who exactly has something to offer?  Bernie, and us.  We are the ones actually advocating the left.  The real left, not just a politically correct, but economically regressive left wanna be.  Notice who is talking about those issues?  It's US and Bernie, and interestingly, quite a few Republicans, who can't feed their kids and get health care same as us.

Class level problems.  They cross party lines.

We say, RESIST TRUMP, and we link that resistance right to those issues.  That is EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE.  Big difference!

Here is a sample:

Most people love hate the ACA.  Some few of us are really helped, a lot are worse off, and still more don't care, because it mostly doesn't affect them.  

Trump says, REPEAL THE ACA.  REPLACE, maybe with something, someday.  We all know that means REPEAL and call it a day.

Dems?

RESIST TRUMP, SAVE THE ACA.  Nice, but not really progress.  Leaves us where we are now, which isn't in all that good of a place.  Costs are high, rising just as the real left said they would, people can't afford to use coverage they are forced to buy, etc....  It's a mess.

Us?  Bernie?

RESIST TRUMP, MEDICARE FOR ALL!

Now, that's nice!  Solid, no fucking around, take back for the little people.  Bet your ass people will get behind that shit.  Why not?

We are directly advocating economic good, progress, for the majority of ordinary Americans in growing need.  They are not doing that, instead advocating we go back to ""we don't suck as much as the GOP!"", which really isn't progress, but more like coping, economically speaking.  

Who wants to go to bat for that shit?  Any wonder we didn't get the votes?  None man.  None at all.  Any wonder Dems have lost 1000+ seats in 6 years?  Again, none.  Who really wants to work hard for that garbage?  

In these next mid-terms, say we get a bunch of people elected.  JusticeDemocrats.com and BrandNewCongress both are seeking to elect people on progressive ideas.  Both parties, indies, no fucking around.  Just replace a lot of corporate assholes with people funded by ordinary people, being for those ideas, accountable to ordinary people, not wealthy donors and corporations.

This is the help Bernie needs!  We can give it to him, and he can work with it.  That's what this whole run for POTUS was about!  Make the movement, get people involved, win elections, advance the ideas.  It's US or nobody.

Now, say Dems get their heads out of their asses and go for MEDICARE FOR ALL.

Suddenly there is support for that, and it's bi-partisan!  The party is stronger within it's ranks, which is a goal some of us have, and the ideas are stronger within government overall, which is a goal most of us have.  

Lots of ways to work this.  Being about ideas, being about positive politics, voting for good explicitly matters.  It's a game most are not used to playing.

What they are used to playing is tribal and rather useless given the same economics are on tap from both teams, the difference being extreme or moderate.  Shit sandwich with cheeze, or without, basically.

In that game, the other side IS PURE EVIL, WE MUST WIN.  Actual good is implied, and it's implied for good reason economically.

Guess what that reason is?

Because they do not plan on doing any real economic good!  The wealthy donors won't have that, and since they are the ones paying for the politics, why in the world would they do that only to have to pay more for the common good?

So we must do this.  It's a challenge to the order, all fronts.

Don't ever vote GOP, if you don't want to.  It's not important that you do, or no where near as important as being about the ideas is, and understanding that we ordinary people are the only left economic force in the USA today.  

We either do this, or it's never, ever gonna get done.  Or maybe it will be done, someday, when money is out of politics.

How soon do you believe that is going to happen without us first taking some government back for the people to help make it happen?

Years, decades, if ever.

This?

Can happen right fucking now.  

And are there risks?  Bet your ass there are risks, but just think about the big ass risk the DNC took by ramming Clinton down our throats, ""her turn"", ""she deserves it"" style.

It's not like we deserved her, is it?  It's not like it was their call to make, was it?

Of course not.  Fucked us, and for what?  Raw, unbridled greed.  Money.  

Nobody actually gave a fuck about us, little people.  No, this was about career politicians looking to make sure the big money gravy train continues to be there for them so they don't actually have to work for it by getting it from us, the people they are supposed to represent.

It's a new day man.  The old game got shot to hell last election.  Americans didn't take the deal.  Americans didn't agree to a majority of us suffering so a minority can live well and get along socially wasn't deemed worth the economic pain that has caused.

Establishment referendum election.

It remains an establishment referendum, until we get economic progress too.  It has to.  Why?

Those majority of Americans just don't have options.  Forced.  

And who is at fault?

Not us.  Corporate politicians created every single one of us.  Now that we are a majority, it's payback and take back time, and that is what this movement, sub, etc... is all about.

"More socialist nonsense.  Highly paid executives are not paid that because of their hard work.  They are paid because they consistently make the right decisions.  This reduces risk and that creates a huge payoff because you don't need supporting systems to manage risk.  For instance if the grocery store was only able to guarantee that food would be on the shelves 11/12 months you would need another system to take care of the risk that the next month would not have food.  If the grocery store can guarantee that food will be available all the time we don't need a redundant system and the grocery store takes the resources that would be dedicated to the redundant store as a winners bonus.  

This happens all over and the higher you go the more important it is that every decision be the right one because people might literally die or massive losses might occur over slight hiccups.  As an example on the lower scale most people cannot even guarantee that they will come to work on time or do their jobs well and willingly and as a result we have to invest in managerial structures.  Those who are able to do so can be rewarded with higher pay, more favorable conditions, etc. as they capture the resources that would go into managing them and so it goes from there.

I am not saying that ubi won't be necessary to keep people alive or that a lower workweek is impractical.  I am saying that historically power concentrates to the elite during periods of stability and that is appropriate as redundant systems are wiped out due to proper management of systemic risk.  The author seems to think that the riches of the world belong to the people and that is just not how it works.  Only during periods of instability like the Black Death or the world wars or perhaps riots where the elite fail to manage risk does it become apparent that stabilizing systems are necessary and that is when the common man tends to do well."

"Delta has three primary uses. One is the percentage likelihood that an option finishes in the money, the second it the hedge level requires to neutralize a position, and the third is how much money you make or lose on a dollar move in the underlying.

You can extrapolate these three basic definitions to do a world of different things. Delta is probably the most important of the Greeks.

Delta is still incredibly useful in these products but they do require an extra understanding of how things like skew, gamma, vega, theta, etc. all work at the bare minimum.

In your example, as the underlying goes up, those $16 calls will have a higher vega (the more ATM an option is, the higher the vega). This is expected behavior in every product and not VIX-exclusive. The thing that might add to the increasing price here is an increase or move in the skew curve. Typically we see a skew curve like this in indices: http://www.optiontradingpedia.com/image/volatility_skew.jpg

Since the fear is to the upside in the VIX (obviously) and because it's a derivative of volatility, we see a skew curve to the upside which can rapidly steepen when the market plummets.

This is all a very basic explanation and if you want a better understanding of option Greeks, I'd recommend reading Option Volatility and Pricing by Natenberg (the first 6 or 7 chapters explain all this stuff)."

"An RRSP is a box where whatever you put into it is supposed to be for retirement. It can be a savings account, it can be an investment, it can be a number of financial products.

It's a tax deferral thing, meaning whatever money you put in you can get the income tax that you paid on what you put in refunded to you now, but when you pull it out when you retire you must pay income tax on it.

That's the gist of it, there are a few more parts to it, you have a limit on how much you can put into it each year (a percentage of last year's income). You can use it for the Home Buyer's Plan or for going back to school. And at a certain age you must start taking money out of it (71 I believe).

"For the newbies:

You sent some bitcoins before the transaction sending them to you was confirmed. That is always risky and most wallets either don't let you do that or they warn you about it.

The reason it is risky is that if the originating unconfirmed transaction is never confirmed (which is a possibility), then your transaction will never be confirmed .

In your specific case, not only is the transaction sending bitcoins to you not confirmed, but a transaction sending the bitcoins to your sender is not confirmed. In fact, there is a whole chain of transactions (8 in total) waiting for that one transaction to confirm. If that one transaction fails to confirm, then all 8 transactions will fail."

"These churches are far from the norm.  It is pretty gross that they are raking in almost 9 million a year from donations.  

You are still not going to get any meaningful revenue in the aggregate from them.  

In 2010 40% of all charitable donations were to Religious organizations.  That is about 4 billion dollars, I am finding it difficult to locate information on the number of active churches in Canada, but if we figure that maybe 10-15% of them turn a profit (liberal estimate in my books) thats maybe $600 million revenue to tax.  If you assume the margin of the mega church you listed (which I will use the 2014 values, because they operated at a loss in 2015) that works out to be a $20 million in taxable profits for all religious giving in Canada, assuming no distinction between their operation line tax status.

It is a fools errand, even in the case of the super church here.  

I do not see the point of creating some kind of regulatory mess to correct a perception that all churches do is proselytize.

"We are not heavily subsidised - if that's what you think then that explains why you think we need to produce a plan to replace the subsidy.

Start with the deficit - theoretically ¬£12.7 billion (8.6 per cent of GDP) based on GERS excluding oil. 

Let's try and deal with some of the deficit immediately:

* Oil revenue was artificially depressed recently because of refactoring and tax incentives - back to a low normal, it will bring ¬£1bn per year. If it grows later, it'll bring up to ¬£5bn per year or more - but it's not bankable, so we'll call it ¬£1bn.
* We won't have to spend ¬£3+bn on HS2 any more - I think that's over 10 years, so that's ¬£300 million knocked off
* No more trident cost - another ¬£250 million saved
* We would probably take a rental payment from rUK in order to keep trident missiles in the Clyde for a period of time - maybe ¬£100m per year? maybe more?
* We'd maybe have to cut aid from ¬£1bn down to ¬£500m
* Maybe defense budget drops from ¬£3bn to ¬£2bn
* Immigration encouraged because it brings working people who bring net economic benefit and help us close our pension gap - call it an extra ¬£100m?
* Companies relocating to Scotland to stay in EFTA? I can't put a figure on that - you think they would leave Scotland, I think the opposite - to be fair, that means this figure is anything between -¬£1bn and +¬£1bn
* Improved mental health - ¬£7bn cost to economy - we can save/generate ¬£1bn here
* Eliminate APD and increase tourism - ¬£1bn
* Reduce NHS costs and increase availability by installing AI at GP surgeries and online - anything between ¬£1bn and ¬£3bn saved
* Legalise drugs and profit to the tune of ¬£1bn

So far that's ¬£8bn gone from the deficit at the stroke of my keyboard.

Just think how many great plans the Scottish parliament will come up with when they engage experts from around the world to help, as they always do.

Still - it doesn't matter - even if we couldn't cut the deficit, the economy will still be safer out of Westminster's hands.

Edit: Also - read this - Scotland has paid ¬£31bn more than it has received - http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12332074.Figures_explode_subsidy_myth_Scotland_gave__27bn_more_than_was_received/"

&gt; &amp;quot;Together with our allies and the Government of Ukraine, the Canadian Armed Forces will continue to support the professional development and enhance the capabilities of the Ukrainian Armed Forces through a range of training activities such as: small team training, explosive ordnance disposal, military policing, medical training and logistics system modernization,&amp;quot; the Canadian government said in a statement.

&gt; &amp;quot;Canada is unwavering in its support to Ukraine, both in helping to preserve and protect Ukraine&amp;#039;s sovereignty, and in providing assistance to Ukraine to implement key reforms. Operation UNIFIER represents a critical piece of our multifaceted support to Ukraine,&amp;quot; Chrystia Freeland said.

&gt; In particular, Canada has contributed over $16 million in non-lethal military equipment to Ukraine&amp;#039;s armed forces.

"I'm a nurse. I remember as an atheist I loved that they taught us in nursing school never to bring up religion. It's cool to give your two cents if the patient brings it up, but never being it up yourself, and definitely never force your beliefs on a patient. It's amazing after over 6 years in this field it seems like the majority of nurses just don't fucking get it. From playing what they call ""worship music"" openly in the workplace, to talking about religion with patients and their family without even finding out what religion they are in the first place. I'm glad this bitch got in trouble. Fuck her and everyone like her."

Finally an honest answer. You atheists are a stubborn bunch. So you hope that nothing happens after you die. That's fine I just wanted to hear what you truly hope might happen. A bit bleak but at least you were honest.
"Your post is really confusing. I don't think there can be an honest survey of people who have attempted suicide to ask them if their kid has improved. I think it's obvious that since the vast majority never try again, that their life HAS improved. If it was worse than when they tried to kill themselves, the lowest point they could possible go...and not it's even worse like you say, then why are 98% of the people not trying again?  I'm not saying they flip a switch and life is all of a sudden grand, but if their life is worse than they day they tried to kill themselves, then I don't see why more aren't attempting again. 

&gt;but as someone who has been receiving professional help for over 30 years, it is minimally effective at best, unless that person is wealthy and has access to GOOD help they will likely receive no significant help at all, 

I'm very sorry that you can't get better help I your State. That really sucks, but your statement is very subjective. Just because it doesn't work for you doesn't mean it hasn't worked for millions of other people. For ex. I live in the south and I've never seen a white man call a black man the N word...so I guess it doesn't really ever happen at all, right?  Nah, we know it's happening, just like we see the extremely high numbers of people who don't attempt suicide again. 

&gt;it's just enabling people to continue an emotional unhealthy habit in the name of extremist capitalism. Not everyone has it so good that life is worth continuing, and I think the failure of greater society to accept and create compassionate means for an end, that is a real tragedy. So much needless suffering perpetuated in the name of devaluing labor and keeping more consumers around to spend money and make the rich even richer.

Are you saying that the government only tries to help suicidal people live because they need them for shitty jobs and to buy more products to build wealth for the rich?  

&gt;It's actually C.: Don't fuck any of them, let them decide their own fate and don't intervene in someone's choice about their own life. 

I understand your position here, but like I said before, the majority of people who attempt suicide and fail choose life and don't try suicide again. You would have to imagine that nearly all of those people say that their suicide attempt was a mistake and they are glad they survived...if they hate that they survived, what keeps them from doing it again??  That's why I said the ""pick a side"" comment. You say let them all die of they want, but statics show that it's NOT really what they want. It's a permanent fix for a temporary situation.
Quick google search of celebrities who have attempted.  http://www.thetalko.com/15-famous-women-who-barely-survived-a-suicide-attempt/
I think it's safe to say that most of them were happy to survive their attempts.  Now I get that it might be easier for them than common folk, but who is really to say it is?  Look at the situations that they list for trying...all temporary situations, but they couldn't see past them at the time. Now they know better. 

&gt;anyone who tries to claim that ""the suicidal are selfish"" horse shit is ignorant,

Don't get hung up on the negative connotation of the word. It is a very accurate word to describe suicide. Nobody in their right mind could get mad and say, ""That selfish asshole killed himself!"" (Well, I guess in a very extreme circumstance like  a murderer hanging himself in a jail cell before trial), but nobody would say, ""That selfish 15 yr old that always got bullied killed himself!""  The reason the word is thrown into the mix is because suicide is done by one person to benefit themselves, but it's negative effects are ONLY felt by the ones left behind that have to suffer the loss. By definition, it is a ""selfish"" act.

&gt;I was thinking of it as, if I were to kill X's unborn baby at any stage in its development, I could reasonably get charged with fetal homicide in most places. I don't think too many would argue against that being a logical course of action against me. But in the case of abortion, it's no longer fetal homicide just because the woman chose to kill it instead.

exactly; the fetus has no value to itself, at it is not conscious. it has no value to society as they have not invested in it yet. the only value it rightfully might have is the parents and if they don't want it, it has no value at all. see it all depends on whether the parents want it or not.

&gt;My mother can't decide it's now time to kill me and it be legal because she said so

no because society has invested in you and you have value to yourself

I believe the concept of sovern nations and borders is becoming outdated. Rather than competing with each other we should be working together as a planet. 

I think an organization like Facebook could revolutionize global politics in to a new world order. The problem lies in a corporation running the show. Their morals are not in line with making something like this work. However if a concept like this came with strict civil oversight and regulation it could work. 

I imagine a system where everyone in the world can participate in government through technology. You are given an account at birth similar to a social security number. Everything is connected to the account from banking to voting. It could remove so much of the overhead waste and speed up governing processes. We teach everyone how to use it in school. We could pool tax income to end homelessness, hunger and healthcare. We could form organizations like the EPA and NASA to serve the world as one.

"A disasterpeice.

Trump is the fulfilment of neoliberal (post Reagan) hyper reality, it's crowning just as the last vestiges of it's manifestation in popular media lose their power.

Trump is the face of 1980s triumphalist business culture, Patrick Bateman's idol, made all the more perfect incarnation by his ineptitude and record of failures, all sizzle no steak.

While he never filmed any infomercials (as far as I'm aware) there's something about his nature that suggests them. [Look at how quick the media was to brand his campaign ads infomericals](https://www.google.co.nz/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=trump%20infomercials). Coupled with ill thought out, speculative products, like Trump steaks and Trump university (and even his whole existence as a ""brand"") that speak to that 90s manifestation of the hyperreality of 80s business culture (while in its more mainstream guise advertising culture became, first a lot more aggressive, and then a lot more adept at both ""speaking to people where they live"" (rather than condescendingly from the mountain of business confidence) and co-opting the vocabulary of subcultures)

What makes Trump the perfect capstone to the neoliberal experiment though is how easily he slid into a leading role in the hyperreality of the 2000s, reality TV, a place where the false confidence of the 80s, faking it until you make it, was free to run totally wild, its only constraint - to be entertaining, to be a spectacle (really the only part of it he was good at) . 

[Now as reality TV is on its deathbed](http://www.businessinsider.com/afp-grim-new-reality-for-once-popular-tv-genre-2015-1?IR=T) the embodiment of the hyperreality of neoliberalism lifts its bloated carcass onto the throne, to grant us a final gift of crisis and despair before we put it in the ground.

"The geologic history is the difference. Continents have been around for generally a long time and have had different processes occur to them compared to islands. I believe most islands were formed from under-sea volcanoes spewing enough lava to breach the surface of the ocean. Comparatively, continents have been around long enough for events such as continent - continent interactions resulting mountain building events, hence the geologists from the articles comments on mountain ranges being present. 
It could also have something to do with tectonic plates and the composition of the crust in a certain area. Oceanic vs continental crust is very different in density, mineralogy, and mode of genesis. However I am not totally sure (just a geology undergrad) and would be interested in what a geologists answer would be. "

"&gt;  I think changes should solely be based on if the Bitcoin protocol is not compromised and should be based on technical abilities.

&gt; However, it will be extremely damaging to Bitcoin if the hard fork is a political move, consensus could not be achieved and was based only on the market.

The protocol upgrade for the block size has always been completely technical and non-political.

On the other hand, the people wanting to stop it have turned it political. And stopped it being a uncontentious fork. Even when the market is looking to do the upgrade even without their support, they started to be even more political. Not more technical.

So, sure, it would be wonderful if we can do everything from a technical point of view, but unfortunately when it comes to money and assets, there will be those that go and make it political."

Though the full agenda remains unclear, the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective that would be likely to require major concessions to Moscow on U.S. sanctions. 

Is this kind of thing common?

"From an article that was posted here a few weeks ago, the notable difference is that companies like Amazon aren't profitable because they are constantly investing in actual productive assets and infrastructure, like robot warehouses, server farms, and trucking fleets. If Amazon went bankrupt tomorrow, they'd leave behind tons of useful stuff to get bought up and put to immediate use.

By contrast, Uber's strategy is to own no capital whatsoever. They're a payment processor disguised as a taxi company, with the cost of their product and the capital that delivers it paid for by their ""partners"". Because Uber makes money as a cut of volume, it's actually in their interest to encourage capital consumption by their drivers, so long as their aggressive recruiting campaign can keep bringing in fresh car owners. (Driving for Uber is really a labor-intensive way of converting the capital value of your car to cash, at a steep discount.)

If Uber goes bankrupt, society will have almost nothing to show for it, aside from some server code that might be informative to others. We won't even have new servers - Uber just rents those too (from Amazon!). All of the investor money being poured in to Uber (and similar services) isn't building new car fleets, or datacenters, or even high-value human capital. It's just getting spent immediately on operational expenses, like marketing and recruiting."

"Do you... sincerely not understand how the concept of franchising works?  I mean, that's fine if you don't, I'll explain it.

A large number of commercial businesses operate as chains - in this case every outlet is part of a cohesive monolith and run by a centralized management.  Central HQ makes decisions that affect and direct all outlets.

However, an alternative system is franchising.  In this system, each outlet is *independently* owned and operated, but pays to opt into a familiar brand.

If I were to open a restaurant called *Johnny's Burger Shack*, people might not come to me as customers since they're not as familiar with me... but if I were to open a *Burger King*, people would recognize the brand and come to my business for an expected standard of fare.  I would also benefit from any advertising or promotions.

As a franchisee, I pay money to a centralized management in licensing fees, and in exchange they give me access to their branding - with the stipulation that it be used in specific, pre-approved manners.  The end result is you walk into a restaurant that functionally is just like any other Burger King, but I maintain independent management rights over the operation so long as I adhere to the look and feel guidelines Burger King corporate has stipulated. (aside: this is why you can get coupons to fast food places that aren't accepted at all outlets)

These are hotels and resorts that kick a cut upstairs to become part of the ""trump luxury family"" rather than be an independent business.  They ran the numbers and the profit boost paying in would net them beats the cost, thus creating a partnership where their privately managed hotel is a Trump Hotel.

He doesn't own them in the sense that the deed to the land is sitting in his vault and the business is registered in his name; he ""owns"" them in the sense that they fall under the umbrella of revenue generators for his bank account.  If the businesses went belly up, he wouldn't be affected (aside from the loss in revenue stream) because they're someone else's business."

"The extension sticker placed on the back of a green card is only issued to people who are applying for a green card renewal (I-90). The ASC will issue a 9-month extension sticker when you come in for fingerprinting, assuming that you have a recent edition green card that is expired or about to expire. If you are only applying for naturalization (N-400), then they will not issue the extension sticker, but you can obtain an I-551 extension stamp ONLY IF you filed Form N-400 over 6 months prior to your green card expiration. This is because technically, your green card should be valid for at least 6 months when you apply for naturalization. This regulation is not enforced when it comes to your naturalization interview and ceremony, so it is still possible to naturalize with an expired green card."

"Globalism isn't a tide; it's a tsunami. It is the single most impactful change trend in our world barring climate change. 

Globalism is not something that can be stopped. Why not? The Internet exists. International flights and travel exists. Supply chain/logistics experts exist, and furthermore, they're in constant demand because companies need people to maximize increasingly complex international business chains to minimize costs. We live in an increasingly globalized world. Capitalism entails that our world will continue to become increasingly globalized. 

You cannot fight a phenomenon like this. A company cannot fight it. A country cannot. If you attempt to, you will lose to others who do embrace and adapt to the change. That's only capitalism, that's just basic evolution.   

 Deciding to fight globalism is beginning to build a wall while the tsunami is knocking on your front door. You will drown. "

So the total cost to me is still 1 million $. Aren't I paying the shareholders for their business and long term debts are a part of their business only. So why does enterprise value also includes long term debt in my cost."

"The Sunnis living in major towns should unite with the government in rebuilding their country. Even if the country were to be split, there would be competition over natural resources like water. So splitting it up will not be an option for many of them.

Many Iraqis fled the country and are living as refugees all over the world, including in the nearby countries like Saudi Arabia and Jordan. If Iraq were to be rebuilt and have a strong North, then some of those refugees would be able to return. As it is, a lot of stability is found in the South where the government runs from, and the South is ruled by Shia with the support of Iran.

Iraq's rivers and lakes would be the natural destinations of major towns. Even if new towns were to be created, they would follow those natural resources just like the old towns.

It gets tricky because nearby countries may be eager to grab some of Iraq's riches. Saudi Arabia might have dreamed of carving out a Sunni kingdom in Iraq, while splitting it into 3 parts. A Sunni one that would keep control of a lot of Iraq's water. And it would also serve as a pathway for pipelines if those dreams were to be realized.

For the time being though, Russia's ""visit"" to Syria has provided America and the West with an incentive to keep Iraq from being fully independent. One alternative would be for a European approach to city building in Iraq with modern sewage treatment and so on. I have difficulty believing in this because America may not be comfortable in midland, away from the ports and other natural fortifications. Also by investing in one city, the people living in other cities could grow jealous and want some love as well. Can the Shia government demonstrate some love for their Sunni brethren? Even for Iraq itself, it may be difficult to envision sponsoring major cities away from their own ports.

And when it comes to it, how would they protect the roads from being misused by the bad guys potentially living in nearby countries? I recall it when they would go back and forth between Iraq and Syria using barely any road at all. The desert provides trucks with a lot of grip already, as it became evident when America stormed Iraq in that successful war.

And then we ought to consider the tribes that don't rely on cities at all. How to get them interested in ""paying taxes?""

Iraq needs to start using things like solar panels to provide energy for their people. But if countries like America and Russia etc are not on the side of renewables, they can spoil it for Iraq too. Saudi Arabia has been enjoying some success with solar panels. A mini solar panel can provide a small house with some lamps for a few hours every night. Just tuck a few more of those and boom the desert house is on its own thank you very much.

With more solar panels, Iraq could have clean energy to power up their water plants. The population would be happy and potentially be farming their own food again.

Now does America want that to happen? Does Russia? Does Iran? Does Saudi Arabia? Does Israel?

And lastly, I bet that Europeans hate the heat in those deserts to call it their home."

Meanwhile, most of us have to deal with deep industry knowledge being locked up in 'that guy down the hall who worked on that ten years ago', how do we know that's the guy who has the knowledge? We asked the people around us and found out, then we had to go walk down the hall and bug him.

should this be how it works? No. absolutely positively no. Every last one of the issues can be solved, and it appears that for many of them you don't have them, or have alternatives you are religious about the problem at that solves it. For the rest of us, our bosses refuse to pay for or allow us to use our time on, things which solves a problem they don't even seem to understand exist.

When I check out the [SLS Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System) it's telling me that the SLS boosters have 7.2 Million pounds of thrust and the First stage has 1.6 Million pounds of thrust so then do we combine that and say 8.8 M pounds of thrust?"

"Haha okay sorry maybe I should have posted a more beginner post by the same blogger. She has a bunch of great guides and was really helpful for me when I started. I still read and re-read a lot of her guides when I start new products or want to remember things. She's very informative. Her beginner guide for skin types is maybe where you want to start then.

Apple cider vinegar is a good starting point. You definitely want to start by lowering the pH of your skin so a toner or low pH cleanser or apple cider vinegar would all do that. It is not an active though. It is not actively chemically exfoliating your skin, which is what the other actives are doing, it's just lowering the pH. Which is okay. There are a lot of good actives that are not too harsh that you could easily start with like BHA or Vitamin C.

I would definitely say though that you should find some good moisturizers first though because once you start with an active it's going to dry your skin out.

I hope that this gets better for you. My skin has been slowly getting better and better over time since I've started AB but it's a long process trying to find that work for you because everyone's skin is so different. I will say once I started mixing my tretinion with an essence it was like OMG WHOLE NEW WORLD. So even though you had a bad experience with one thing before it doesn't mean you are always doomed or nothing is going to work for you.

I would say the best thing that helped me starting out was finding a blogger with the same skin type as me. It was really helpful having suggestions from someone who has the same skin concerns you do.

Also I saw someone else posting how a hydrocolloid bandages ripped the top off their acne. That's so weird cause nothing remotely close has ever happened to me.

"Open offices are preferred by bean counters because they do a cost/benefit analysis, but they don't quantify the benefit, so they can reduce the facilities cost without loss, they think.

We've known since the '70s that an office door that closes increases productivity by 30% or so, and that has been continuously true since then, affirmed by study after study. (It's also like 3x as effective as the next most effective change. I.e., the next benefit you can apply increases productivity 10%.)

But the people who make those decisions are the people running the company, not the people doing heads-down work. The job of a manager is to have meetings, not get the detail work done. So the idea of focus, or not being interrupted every 30 minutes for a different meeting, just doesn't tend to click.

"Beg to differ here. There's a fair amount of data entry in my field that is actually duplicated work either due to policy like in cases of confidentiality.

The current process of communicating between electronic health record systems usually means that information often goes from electronic to paper and then back to electronic. The human component lies in the paper step where we receive information and then have to transcribe it onto another electronic system for another healthcare provider, public health surveillance system, etc. This is time consuming and costly (think paper, toner, and physical file management). If this process can be fully automated, then you eliminate the duplicate work of entering data that was already stored in an electronic format. As in the moment the doctor enters the info into your electronic health record, then that info can stay electronic despite different systems.

Right now most health care systems do not fully share information with each other, but that is changing and withit certain data entry jobs are going to disappear just for my field alone. "

"MUAC's toner is an acid exfoliant. A new AHA will have a bit of a tingle or burn- esp when it's potent, well-formulated, and contains alcohol as the MUAC toner does.

It's not unexpected- you went from using ONLY a hydrating toner, to using an ACTIVE. Acids are for ""rebuilding"" the skin and so some level of discomfort sometimes happens. MUAC toner, IMO shouldn't be used daily, ESPECIALLY not at the start. 

MUAC toner has nothing in common with the Hada Labo and shouldn't be substituted. Did you read the ingredients or description of the MUAC toner before purchasing? It seems you bought it and only looked at the word toner. It's VERY important to understand what an item will do to your skin- for instance you cannot use mandelic acid until you have a really robust sunscreen routine, which is not true of a bland hydrating toner like the HL. Mandelic acid/exfoliants in general shouldn't be used on dehydrated skin either, while there are no such warnings against hydrating toners. Be very careful when switching products that you understand what you are buying."

I dont believe that just because we have opposing opinions that your post should be discounted. You've done good homework, provided information and done a good job. I'll revise my statement to be basically ""Code exists, but has not been injected into a branch release for testing"". 

And to that, you have a point. Its not been put into a branch (even a forked one) for testing. That would be mostly trivial for one of the developers of course, yet if it was a serious proposal maybe it should have been completed?

I go to college in a rural area halfway between two cities, with a number of programs involving agriculture, auto repair, manufacturing, and other largely blue-collar industries (personally I'm in wind energy and electromechanical programs), so the proportion of right-leaning, small-town folks ‚Äì who fit at least a few of the classic rural American stereotypes ‚Äì is higher than the average at most colleges (at least of the three I've attended). 

Almost on a daily basis I overhear conversations that make me shake my head in disgust or disappointment in my fellow humans, from a group of people laughing about steering and accelerating their pickup trucks *toward* any animals crossing the road, scoffing at people that hit their brakes, to any number of horrifyingly ignorant statements about minority groups, etc. I tend to lean progressive ‚Äì with some exceptions ‚Äì and it can be hard at times to find like-minded people there, although overall I feel the staff and administration, in general, are reasonable and forward-thinking. 

The main instructor for the Nuclear Energy Tech program is from China and is still working on his English since he speaks with a strong accent, and while I've heard some student complaints (not as much about the accent as you would think, but more just about him), the staff is great in supporting him, having his back, and helping him in whichever way they can.

As for the mission statement, I take it then that this sub is dedicated to *American* conservativsm? Social and fiscal conservatism are very broad terms if applied internationally, and although I usually don't try to squeeze my beliefs into neat little brackets, I can certainly be said to be fiscally conservative in many issues regarding the Swedish economy.

I agree that might be somewhat of a cop out and if you really don't want me here then I'll stop using this sub. I would advise you, however, to update the mission statement to clearly express your American focus in order to avoid confusion in the future.

I think most of the time I comment it's because I disagree with someone but in this sub I don't disagree with people on issues that are strictly conservative. I have talked with people here recently about the Swedish situation regarding immigration in relation to the president's recent statements about it, and I did disagree with many people here on that one.

"I totally disagree. LGBT people have quite a number of specific medical needs: from unique disease screenings, to the consequences of being on hormones, to simply being able to discuss your health in the context of your relationship (such as: I need to lower my cholesterol, but my husband isn't so on board with my diet). 

A doctor or medical practice that isn't LGBT aware (a separate but related state of being to ""friendly"") can't provide that comprehensive health care needed with a PCP. 

Some personal anecdotes:

A recommend PCP I checked out near where I used to live said that they were open to LGBT patients, but had Focus on the Family literature in their waiting room and talked about ""tolerating my lifestyle""

I went into an ER with an infection in my leg and was informed by the staff that I ""probably had AIDS"" upon arrival, based on me being on my (now-ex) husband's insurance. This was before any diagnostics had been done. 

The nursing and reception staff at the endocrinologist who my husband used to see insisted on misgendering him. 

My (awesome) PCP was out on maternity leave and I got strep throat. Expressing concern that I seemed to get strep anytime I deep throated someone (though I used nicer language), and wondering if that could mean we weren't completely wiping out the infection with the antibiotics, the NP got extremely upset and informed me that that was not an appropriate thing to bring up or discuss with her. 

And I've gotten into occasionally heated arguments with a number of doctors, nurses, and medical assistants over whether or not I'm HIV positive, based on me taking PrEP. People unfamiliar with the protocol insist that my Truvda means that I'm Poz, and have even insisted that I was making PrEP up. "

"April fools, of course, but I actually checked out Doge yesterday. I haven't even thought about it for years. Surprisingly their valuation is somewhat stable, the community seems in decent spirits, and they seem open to changes. 

Right now there is discussion on how to build a bridge between Doge and Ethereum so you can transfer Doge to an Ethereum token and the Doge gets locked in the chain. Then when someone wants to transfer back, they're modifying the Doge miner software to accept the unlock transaction from the Ethereum network.

"&gt; Gender is most often described in the social construct

I've never understood this argument. It's basically saying that a difference in gender is made up, doesn't exist, and is artificially created by society. But hasn't every society for thousands of years had ""gender rolls"" and a clear distinction between genders? Seems pretty unlikely that society's all across the globe have made up gender differences, but the supposed truth (that genders are made up), has *only* come out in the last few decades. 

Basically every society for thousands of years made up genders out of thin air? But you're right when you say it's totally made up? Like I get stupid things like pink is girly etc are societal, but if I'm understanding the argument corrects they are saying that *all* our understanding of genders are made up by society. It just doesn't make sense when viewed historically "

No one says ""we're going to let ISPs sell your info"", they say stuff about costly regulations, and free markets. The language is veiled, but it's there.

&gt;The FCC had been very reluctant to use that section of the law because telecom companies like Comcast and Time Warner would freak out.

I'd mention that it wasn't just the companies who were against it. Making something a common carrier is a fairly big deal(and not necessarily easily undone if something went wrong), so it wasn't just complete self interest that had prevented it.

Obviously, most of us think it was worth it, but it's not as completely trivial that regulators had sold out or something. (Although you can make a good argument that they were being way overly timid)


They had to use the same section of law as phone companies because Congress hasn't really updated things, but it also obviously wasn't designed with that in mind, which had some downsides.They weren't totally sure if it would hold up in court, although as you mentioned, it seems to have, so far. That was another reason they tried to avoid doing it. 

&gt;Congress just used the Congressional Review Act (a 1996 law which had hardly ever been used until this year) to overturn the FCC rule.

This is also why it only took 50 votes in the Senate (probably not super important, but figured I'd mention it)."

This is a frequently shared statistic, mostly because it's very American Dreamy without anchoring itself to any standard of comparison. I've never seen the validity of this metric established. It could very well be the case that having a high ""small business"" density is a sign of a poorer or lower skill population, which are in low-wage, small-firm-size industries like gardening or housekeeping. For years I myself was a ""small business"" for tax purposes as part of my field of employment -- and I was still low-income, falling behind on taxes, etc. Being a ""small business"" was an aspect of my lower status, not a marker of ascendant prosperity.

"not sure if you are an Xer or older, if you are not, please keep in mind that millenials and younger have no conception about what NATO exists for or what it is like to live under the constant threat of global thermo nuclear war.

in nov of 1983, NATO almost ended the world with it's US led ABLE ARCHER war game along the soviet border, along with pulling out the stops to help us ring the soviet border, esp the part closest to germany, with pershing nuclear missles.

the only thing that allows any of us to exist right now is a russian double agent at NATO pleading with them that the USSR was convinced ABLE ARCHER was the 2nd coming of OPERRATION BARBAROSA--hitler's war game ruse to line up his military along the russian border and invade--over 20 million russians died because OPERATION BARBAROSA worked.

in the end, it wasn't NATO that backed down, they were dead set on playing their game all the way to DEFCON 1, at which point reagan was slated to call in and pretend to give the order to launch. it was james mcfarland, reagan's chief of staff,  who took the double agent seriously and convinced reagan not to participate. 

the soviets had already sent their launch codes out, and had put every tank and jet and sub into action for counter strike. this would have happened on thanksgiving, 1983. i was 11 years old. that same weekend ""the day after"" aired, permanently scaring genX.

in the 1990s, NATO was slated to be disolved because its purpose for existing ended the day the berlin wall fell, but the neocons--many like cheney and rumsfeld, who as part of reagan's cabinet, had been behind the pershing missle deployment and ABLE ARCHER, returned to power in 2000 and saved NATO.

NATO is only slightly less insane than the CIA, but much more deadly. the CIA can distabilize, it can't order the launch of nuclear warheads.

as for the EU, it has been on the verge of dissolving since the day it was formed--several countries including the most important, the UK, never even adopted the euro. the EU is composed of countries that have hated each other for a thousand years. it's just taken them this long to regain their strength. the first thing every american who lives there is struck by is the level of racism and nationalism. nationalism in america is and always has been about jobs. nationalism in europe is and always has been about which is the best ra e. they still veiw each other as distinct races. the think of americans as a distinct race.  

the EU is europe's problem. there is nothing we can do or should do, any more than they should get involved in NAFTA. the countries in europe are more than capable of figuring out their own issues.

Yes it's partly to do with brain chemistry.  But it's definitely to do with the plant chemistry and it's an effect that could easily be studied.  There has to be a compound or two or two hundred causing such effects.    This stuff need to be researched heavily."
"The problem with the balanced growth fund (and others like it) is that the 1.5% fees heavily eat into your profits.  Over the course of decades this can end up being a very substantial amount.

If it seems daunting right now, fair enough, you're not alone.  You can, however, think about it more simply.  Instead of putting all of your money into 1 fund, you're putting a set proportion of your money into 4 funds.  The process is easy.  You just contribute your money to the online brokerage of your choice.  Type in which fund you want to buy and how much of it you want to buy, and boom, it's done.

Now say you leave it alone for a year and forget about it.  When you check your account instead of your initial allocation of 25% for each fund you get something like:

-Fund 1: 30% (did well this year!)
-Fund 2: 25% (was flat)
-Fund 3: 35% (did VERY well this year)
-Fund 4: 10% (lost a ton of ground this year)

To rebalance you would just sell off the portions that gained (Fund 1 and Fund 3) and buy up the portions that lost (Fund 4) in order to return the overall allocations t 25% each.  It's actually very simple.

I don't mean to pressure you into anything you're not comfortable with, but you can save a lot of money doing this in this manner than paying some mutual fund manager 2% of your assets every year to do it for you."

"Well if you want to get into it, saying Trump is an outright liar is patently false. The only major claim he's ever told is an outright lie is that global warming is a Chinese hoax, which he now says was a joke and the Obama birther thing. Clinton has repeatedly made up stories that didn't happen, lied about losing information that led to Benghazi, lied about inconsistant on subjects and lied about Obama when she herself made up birther claims against him.

"If ""other Christians"" say no to homosexuality because it is ultimately harmful, then they have to back it up with evidence. A good Christian will quote the scripture as evidence. 
A bad Christian would deny the scripture that is being quoted -
-or you twist the meaning of the quote so that it fits your narrative of allowing/accepting homosexuality making it fall under the umbrella of love
-or see the scripture as being out of context
-or not adhere to the guidance of the scripture 
-or not accept the quotes scripture as evidence 
These apologetic views is more of cognitive dissonance bordering dishonesty - it's like saying you are a member of the KKK but support racial diversity.

In between would be some kind of MyServer+Wallet that can talk to my bitcoind node and manage balances/transactions with all my private keys on the HW wallet.

Reasons are Privacy (broadcast tx directly from a node), robustness, and a healthy distrust of my own computers.

Ledger:  https://ledger.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/how-to-setup-electrum-nano-slash-nano-s

There are Wallets (breadwallet and Bitcoin Wallet for Android) that will connect to a full node directly, but these don't appear to support a hardware wallet/keys.  (Correct?)

"you are correct. However vaccines have a potential to induce autism per design like a weaponized vaccine. There was a time period in which certain versions of vaccines were tested with a specific goal of inducing autism. This is the situation. People are fine with decease preventing vaccines but they are not fine with experimentation intending to create autistic boys. So you need to learn what the real fight is about before you go around yelling. 

We are talking about specific neurological diseases such as Autism. Yes vaccines helped stop certain diseases and now that people are avoiding vaccines those diseases are making a come back. People are avoiding vaccines because of the fear that their child may be induced with Autism. There have been patterns found in which certain geographical areas exhibit a timely rise of male boys with autism which pertains to a specif vaccine type version. Meaning certain version were intended to produce autistic boys. People started investigating after they spotted pockets of increases of autistic kids that shared certain commonalities within a shared geographical area. This got people suspicious and on the version theory. You can see how they selected certain commonality variables per geographical zone to test the version. People are fighting for them to stop introducing autistic and neurological problem inducing vaccines.

Well the govt announced they were getting rid of it.  Did the market respond by people heading towards the door like you saying happened now?

No.  What happened was everyone and I mean everyone was doing a same day sell/buy back to realize their gains before the exemption was gone.  No one just sold and left.  What sense would that make? None.  And same thing here.

Let's say today they announced it's changing to 75% as of Jan 1 18.  Would you sell and just leave this (or any sector) and no longer invest?  Of course not, because it makes no sense.

If they did announce, I would sell all tomorrow and buy back in.  And if they did it retroactive to Jan 1 of this year then it wouldn't matter how you reacted.  So their is no scenario where it makes sense for the market to react like this, because of this.

I forget what the exact numbers were but it was something like $225~ up to $280. I had a Ford Focus as well. No accidents, tickets, etc. 

I'm still with Allstate, but now with a Jeep Wrangler at $208. 

I turn 25 this year, I'm hoping my premium goes down quite a bit once that happens. "

"US Christians allowed the current mess to happen.  Back before Reagan,  we talked about ""Mainstream Christians.""  Evangelicals were considered fringe.

But evangelicals moved out of the fringe with little, if any, opposition from mainstream Christians.  Mainstream Christians did not object when evangelicals started taking over state goverments.  They did not call out teachers of ""prosperity gospel.""  Sometimes they even jumped on the bandwagon.  In the process mainstream Christians allowed evangelicals to steal the Christian brand.  

So don't whine about evangelicals.  You created this mess.   You let the evangelicals tie Christianity to images of racism, ignorance, homophobia, and a host of other labels.  It has cost you almost an entire generation of young people.  Your mainstream churches are dying.  And you are largely to blame."

Having lived in Singapore for the majority of my life, I can tell you that it's more insidious - subtle but present.

"You mean L1 &amp; L2? L3 is on the other side of the Sun from Earth. Idk if any plans to put anything there.

Both L1and L2 are ""metastable"" like balancing a broomstick on your nose. (L3 as well.)

At present iirc there are several satellites in the L1 zone, one if whichbstares at Earth all the time, and the James Webb will live at L2 perpetually shielded from the Sun's heat and light by the shadow of the Earth. I think all of these use ion engines for stationkeeping.

I'm totally guessing, but it's plausible to consider that the use of reflective &amp; non-reflective surfaces at certain angles at the proper times in those orbits might be able to provide enough of a net acceleration vector to be useful. A space engineer whom I know has designed a microsatellite platform that theoretically uses differential light force to navigate around within Earth's orbital field (navigating slowly between any orbit and any other), but that's an easier problem."

"I really think you need to read more, as all your points show you did not read the information I provided. But you yourself said you wanted to reply quickly, so perhaps if you get through more of the material you will begin to understand why I feel this way. I think your faith in technological advancement is seriously misplaced - and hell, I'm in the computer engineering field haha.

Keep in mind this doesn't mean extinction or whatever, I said in my comment that it's too hard to say what will happen. What is certain is that the climatic stability which allowed us to develop plow-based agriculture and grain surplus, leading to civilization, is no longer a given; that our net energy from our primary energy sources is falling rapidly; that all the low-hanging fruit has been picked; and that the biosphere is collapsing.

&gt;Your concerns about food: there's plenty of time between now and 2050 to invent new technologies and develop those already in place. 

Gmos, vertical farming etc have nothing to do with preventing topsoil loss, and in fact modern techniques have actually accelerated our erosion of soil. Vertical farming is not scalable and still obviously requires significant nutrient &amp; energy inputs - always far beyond other types of farming since all inputs are required to come from humans - and as such will only ever constitute a small portion of the global food system. Once again, this is covered in the links I sent, particularly in Vaclav Smil's work and in HSBC's net energy report. Remember, modern agriculture converts oil into food. You must think: where does the energy come from? What are the resource inputs and how are they acquired? etc.

[False](http://whrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/PB_Permafrost.pdf), and misleading on the part of those scientists. It's important to remember that the [IPCC reports in particular](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/13/methane-release-from-melting-permafrost-could-trigger-dangerous-global-warming) require complete [consensus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4w8LudW_2g) among parties, which includes figures from governments.

&gt;Antibiotic resistance is a huge problem, but not unsolvable

It is unsolvable if we continue to act the way we do. I see no evidence of a shift of any kind in global use of antibiotics, but if you have reports for me to read I would welcome them. 

Your own link demonstrates this clearly in saying that drastic reductions in use are required: ""To preserve the potency of existing antibiotics, overall antibiotic use must be decreased ... In addition, non-therapeutic uses of antibiotics in farm animals and agriculture should be eliminated."" The page has a link to [this WHO strategy](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/66860/1/WHO_CDS_CSR_DRS_2001.2.pdf). I suggest you read at least the executive summary.. 

&gt;the  development  of  new  families  of antimicrobials throughout the 1950s and 1960s and of modifications of these molecules through the 1970s and 1980s **allowed us to believe that we could always remain ahead of the pathogens**.

Once again, I really think that once/if you look more closely at the details and stop thinking about these as isolated problems, then you might realize this is not the case.

As for that comment on the ""Strauss-Howe generarional theory"" (sic), [generations are about as valid as astrology](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/01/your-generational-identity-is-a-lie/) - they're just arbitrary social constructs. The theory itself has little supporting evidence and suffers from serious confirmation bias. The authors themselves call it an ""Anglo-American"" cycle but even this cycle they claimed to identify from the past fell apart during the American Civil War - they admit this themselves and discuss it in their work. It seems ridiculous that a theory which can only barely fit the anglo-american sphere would fail regarding the progression of the post-civil war generation.

"Schiff was on TV the other morning saying that he was in favor of an independent commission because he felt that one would have access to more resources than the house committee was getting. He talked about the possibility of the committee coming to two different conclusions along party lines. Yeah, it seems to me that the Republicans are pretty damn eager to sweep all of this away.

He also said that the FBI had recently been more forthcoming with assistance in the last week or two than they had been previously...I'm curious as to what's changed in that time for him to revise that view."

"There are two definitions for it, questioning and queer. As far as I'm aware, questioning was the first definition, but once people in the movement began reclaiming queer, many people began saying that.

Personally, I don't like people saying it means queer for two reasons: we want to make the people who are questioning feel welcome in the community, and making the Q mean queer feels a lot like erasure. Secondly, many people have some very strong feelings about other people assigning the term ""queer"" to them without their consent. I was in this camp for a while, and I still sympathize. It's still a slur for a lot of people and I'm not a fan of applying it to others without them agreeing to it first. "

The data really does not fit that argument. There's been a pretty obvious relationship between difficulty of running a full node and the number of full nodes. I'm guessing that if the block size today were only 250kb, we'd have 3-6x as many full nodes, because IBD would be faster and the software would be much more lightweight.

The evidence is that people really do care about that 100GB of disk space. And in fact I personally would be unable to run a full node today if the chain size were more than 200 GB (without buying more hardware)."

Future life expectancy in 35 industrialised countries: projections with a Bayesian model ensemble

Summary:

&gt; Background
&gt; Projections of future mortality and life expectancy are needed to plan for health and social services and pensions. Our aim was to forecast national age-specific mortality and life expectancy using an approach that takes into account the uncertainty related to the choice of forecasting model.

&gt; Methods
&gt; We developed an ensemble of 21 forecasting models, all of which probabilistically contributed towards the final projections. We applied this approach to project age-specific mortality to 2030 in 35 industrialised countries with high-quality vital statistics data. We used age-specific death rates to calculate life expectancy at birth and at age 65 years, and probability of dying before age 70 years, with life table methods.

&gt; Findings
&gt; Life expectancy is projected to increase in all 35 countries with a probability of at least 65% for women and 85% for men. There is a 90% probability that life expectancy at birth among South Korean women in 2030 will be higher than 86¬∑7 years, the same as the highest worldwide life expectancy in 2012, and a 57% probability that it will be higher than 90 years. Projected female life expectancy in South Korea is followed by those in France, Spain, and Japan. There is a greater than 95% probability that life expectancy at birth among men in South Korea, Australia, and Switzerland will surpass 80 years in 2030, and a greater than 27% probability that it will surpass 85 years. Of the countries studied, the USA, Japan, Sweden, Greece, Macedonia, and Serbia have some of the lowest projected life expectancy gains for both men and women. The female life expectancy advantage over men is likely to shrink by 2030 in every country except Mexico, where female life expectancy is predicted to increase more than male life expectancy, and in Chile, France, and Greece where the two sexes will see similar gains. More than half of the projected gains in life expectancy at birth in women will be due to enhanced longevity above age 65 years.

&gt; Interpretation
&gt; There is more than a 50% probability that by 2030, national female life expectancy will break the 90 year barrier, a level that was deemed unattainable by some at the turn of the 21st century. Our projections show continued increases in longevity, and the need for careful planning for health and social services and pensions.

This section in the paper about the US is notable:

&gt; The USA has the highest child and maternal mortality, homicide rate, and body-mass index of any high-income country, and was the first of high-income countries to experience a halt or possibly reversal of increase in height in adulthood, which is associated with higher longevity.20, 21, 28, 29, 30 The USA is also the only country in the OECD without universal health coverage, and has the largest share of unmet health-care needs due to financial costs.25 Not only does the USA have high and rising health inequalities, but also life expectancy has stagnated or even declined in some population subgroups.1, 2 Therefore, the poor recent and projected US performance is at least partly due to high and inequitable mortality from chronic diseases and violence, and insufficient and inequitable health care.

"Not necessarily, as I said, it depends on what the context is. What the risk free rate is for your specific needs depends on what you're doing.

I like duration matching, where you calculate the duration of your expected cash flows and match to a risk-free bond with the closest possible duration. This ensures you are comparing your project to a risk-free security with the closest possible cash flow structure.

If I wanted to know what the rates on 10 year treasuries were, I would just ask you what they are. ""Risk free rate"" needs a context to have meaning.

There's also lots of other corrupting factors involved in calculating risk-free rates. Coupon Bonds have reinvestment risk, longer maturity bonds have higher risk premiums as a result of lower liquidity, etc, all environmental factors that make bonds no longer ""risk free"", which all have to be weighed on a case-by-case basis by the investor depending on their needs. 

http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/papers/riskfreerate.pdf

Of course this is all probably way beyond the scope of OP's question, however, stating that ""risk-free rate"" universally means ""rate on a 10-year treasury bond"" is not accurate. What the risk free rate is will vary depending on the circumstances of the investor."

"&gt;If there is a major fine/punishment/etc for a stolen gun being used in a crime no one will report guns as stolen anymore  

i think you've misunderstood.  it would work like auto insurance.  you don't pay auto insurance when a crash happens, you pay it from the minute you get the car and if a crash happens, the insurance company pays to compensate the injured parties.  

the proposed gun insurance would work the same way.  if your gun is used in a crime---by anyone---the insurance company pays the costs of the medical care and whatever long-term costs to the victim, up to $250,000 in this case.  

re needing a registry for the proposal to work:  NY already has a gun registry.  and so does every other state with expanded background checks.  any state that wants to can do this, there's no conflict with rights or the 2A or whatever.  and the fed could do it too, all they'd need is to tack on a little rider to some big appropriations bill or something that nixes that one passage from the 1986 FOPA and bang, it's gone.  it's simply an administrative regulation, nothing more.  the courts won't bat an eye since there's no such thing to the right to own guns in secret.

"My point was not that electric cars are *just like* suppressors in every way imaginable, but rather that laws have been made *requiring more noise than is necessary* from some devices on the basis of public safety. That's it. 

You're desperately gaming the example to stretch it to include gas-powered cars (something I was not talking about). Electric cars have never had mufflers. I might, with more justice, ask you what is driving you to do these terrible mental gymnastics. 

I have no desire to burden gun ownership unnecessarily. I have defended the status quo. If I ""win"", nothing changes. You can still pay your $200 and get a stamp and wait if I ""win."" Moreover, I am opened to reasoned arguments. I have recognized and dignified arguments making compelling points in this thread. 

I want to think about the issue critically with other people capable of critical thinking. It just so happens that I think that pro-gunners are more capable of this than anti-gunners (I got banned from gunsarecool after one post). Lefties tend to scream and cry more quickly. Pro-gunners tend to lob personal attacks and get defensive, but they will still engage in rational analysis.

Seems shady to me.  Sorry, don't believe you or your methodology.

&gt; I say if you select a 1000 Americans at random, about 24 will get shot at least once in their lifetime.

Present that very statement to r/theydidthemath and see what happens.  Without being false as hell in your initial premise.

&gt; If that answer is wrong, what is the correct answer?

From the thread:

&gt; The odds of an average American being shot are not 1/40, which is what most of us in this thresd are trying to get at. The 100,000 cannot apply to the larger population and the issue is that you cannot compare it with this potus example because it does not address who is getting shot. Likr others pointed out, things like suicide take up a portion of that.

"I didn't say she's not deportable. I just don't believe that ICE can apply the provisions of the VWP law to process her under expedited removal (deporting her without her seeing an immigration judge) since the only reason they can do that under the law is that the alien consents to that procedure. 

Since she entered as a minor, then she could not have meaningfully consented to those provisions of the law and she is entitled a hearing. It is also goes against a basic principle of law. Although she applied for the DACA renewal late, President Trump has specifically stated that the memo establishing DACA is still in place and this girl has not committed any crimes that make her ineligible for DACA. Her offense is speaking out publicly against the president. Even if you don't think that these kids should be able to stay in the country, I have a problem with the government being arbitrary in how it applies the law.

"Personally I would say that if you have a straightforward case and a good understanding of the process, and if you are prepared to read and thoroughly understand what you're asked to provide, there's no need for a lawyer. Lawyers can't actually do the work of collecting the documents for you, which is the majority of the work involved, and are ultimately humans working from the same guidance that you are -- they probably have more experience than you in the procedure (although it depends on the lawyer!) but ultimately are not invested in the process the way you are, and make mistakes themselves.

I haven't applied for a spouse visa (entry clearance to the UK) but was the sponsor for my husband to apply for FLR(M) (spouse leave to remain in the UK) which is overall very similar in terms of documentary requirements. We didn't use a lawyer, we used lots of official guidance, plus /r/ukvisa and [ExpatForum](http://www.expatforum.com/expats/britain-expat-forum-expats-living-uk/).

If your case is not straightforward, you will want a lawyer. This probably means if you have previous bad immigration history, criminal convictions, or are also applying for entry clearance for a stepchild who you would be moving away from their other parent."

I was trying to keep it short, but don't mind explaining the first crime: In 2002 he was 18 yrs old and he had sex with his 15 yrs old girlfriend. Her mother found out and had him arrested. He was convicted in 2006 as I said. In 2007 the Romeo and Juliet Law passed in Indiana. Prior to 2008 the Age of Consent in Canada was 14 yrs. And even now with the Tackling Violent Crime Act, there is the close-in-age exception.

So my questions are: You said wait 10 yrs for completion of the DUI sentence, do you mean wait until 2027? If 2027, instead of waiting, can we contact a lawyer and instead file for rehabilitation? 

(I admittedly don't know much about the DUI so I don't know how ""serious"" it was. He was driving over the legal alcohol limit, not swerving or anything he says, and passed all the tests except the breathalyzer. He got his license temporarily taken away and 1 yr probation. Out of choice and because he lives in a small town, he didn't drive for years afterwards but now he does, license of course and all)"

Of course, you're right you have to start looking for advice *somewhere*.

Indeed, for a lump sum for growing savings, as you are more concerned with recurring costs, the math works better for ETFs and accumulation class shares.

So beware all the ""hidden"" recurring costs, charged directly by your broker or indirectly by the custodian of your shares: annual custody fees, paper report fees, dividend processing fees (not applicable to your case), corporate action fees (normally unsuccessful ETFs may get merged under more successful ones of the same asset manager, also they may perform share splits and other operations you can get charged by your broker for processing it), etc.

"Your gyn or the midwife could probably evaluate it best. Stretch marks often feel  a bit depressed, like little gaps, while allergic rashes often are raised like hives.

Maybe they look a bit atypical because of the implants (I have so far never seen fresh stretchmarks on breasts with implants, so this is a guess).

There are dermatologists around here, so you might get more input. You can try getting a sharper picture of the red area, too, for better evaluation.

"&gt;What if what's left out isn't a gun but prescription meds? Is that criminal? 

It could be depending on the circumstance

&gt;I would tend to think the negligence would have to be extremely egrigious for me to convict of anything criminal, if I were a juror. A drug dealer who deliberately hides a gun in his kid's playpen, for instance....You do the best you can, try to take reasonable precautions, but at the end of the day you have to train and trust your kids, I think. 

Typically, this is how the law is applied. If a parent took *reasonable* precautions, they generally are off the hook. And we're talking Texas reasonable, not California. If you have a cheap Stack-On safe and your kid picks it open, it's not your fault. If you have a loaded gun in a nightstand and your toddler starts plays with it, you're fucked. But honestly, what kind of parent would leave a loaded gun in ready reach of a toddler? 

Here's a situation I'm personally familiar with. This happened ~15 years ago. There was a deacon in my church that let his teenage daughters know the combination to the gun safe. They had their own guns. They were taught from an early age about gun safety. One evening one of the girls stuck the business end of daddy's shotgun in her mouth and pulled the trigger. Because he had taken *reasonable* precautions, he was not criminally charged.

"&gt;He was describing there the Swiss system, which instead of America‚Äôs for-profit insurance companies uses non-profit ones and then lays out in detail the criteria for all health plans that will be approved by the government, so that now there are 60 insurers there, all of which offer one or more of the authorized types of plans; insurers don‚Äôt supply any dividends and profits to investors (there are no investors) but only meet the requirements of the law, the government, so that all Swiss citizens can rest assured that the insurance company makes no difference ‚Äî only the different categories of the government‚Äôs authorized plans do. Everything is the same within a given plan, except that the insurers can and do vary from one-another on price, on all but the basic plan. I‚Äôve further described elsewhere the Swiss system, and its well-proven superiority ‚Äî in every way ‚Äî over America‚Äôs. More details about the Swiss system can be found here. The history of the Swiss system is here.

&gt;If such a plan were to be proposed by Sanders and endorsed by the President using his White House bully pulpit to sell it to the public, and yet fail to get almost all congressional Democrats and at least enough Republicans behind it to pass it, then both Trump and Sanders would look golden, and everyone who had voted against it would then look lousy; so, it would probably pass. And, in either case, Sanders ‚Äî for his leadership in this ‚Äî would be ideally positioned to beat any Democrat in the 2020 Presidential primaries, and (if polling thus far is any indicator) he‚Äôd easily beat Trump (or especially Pence) in the general election. But it wouldn‚Äôt be only his plan; it would be a compromise between his original proposal, Medicare for all, and the one that Trump described to Scott Pelley on September 27th. But that‚Äôs what any ‚Äúbipartisan‚Äù plan necessarily would be: a compromise.

&gt;Sanders wouldn‚Äôt get Medicare for all, and Trump wouldn‚Äôt get preservation of the existing ‚Äî i.e., for-profit ‚Äî insurance companies. Instead of Sanders‚Äôs governmental insurance system, or Trump‚Äôs for-profit corporate-offered insurance system, it would be a strictly regulated non-profit insurance system ‚Äî which would be based upon the Swiss model, which is already proven to be vastly superior to the American model."

Putin is an autocrat.  Putin, according to all the reports we've seen over Russia's misinformation campaign, had final say on who the Russians were going to sabotage in the election.  Putin is egotistical, or at the very least VERY concerned about maintaining his image to the Russian people as an unbeatable leader, a cult of personality so to speak.  He is also spiteful, as can be seen by the long tally of Putin critics who have had unfortunate things happen to them like committing suicide with two bullets in the back of the skull or the recent one where a lawyer for one of his opponents taking a long walk off a short ledge of a roof.

So, let me hit you with the Occam's Razor again, which is more likely?  That Putin figures he can outplay Trump AND Clinton politically, or at the very least Trump would be more amenable, and he decides to sting and hinder the campaign of the candidate who criticized him a few years ago just to show that he could and to settle his grudge?  Or that he's got some big fancy plan to destroy American democracy?

Personally, I'm going for the Putin's spiteful and wanted to get one over on Clinton because he could.  Democrats were doing a good enough job at destroying American democracy over the past 8 years as is."

"TL;DR of current politics:


Republicans during the Obama administration were lead into a corner of paradoxical values and policies by the Tea Party, a grassroots movement of the extreme Christian Right. These values include preferential treatment for 1950s nuclear families, opposition to illegal immigration and refugees, opposition towards women's health (and healthcare in general), and support for mandatory Christian teachings in public schools. 


By the 2016 election, many of the conservatives in America were angered by the social progress made during the Obama years. A new form of white nationalism called the alt-right which values traditional gender roles, hates LGBT people (especially trans people), is disgusted by what they see as ""political correctness"", opposes Islam in any form, seeks to reverse globalization, and wants to deport or disenfranchise non-whites in America arose with overwhelming support for Trump. Memes and diluted ideology from the alt-right trickled down through social media into the normal Christian Right, garnering more support for Trump. 


This alt-right support, the screentime Trump was given by the media, and support from the Russian government created a perfect storm to overwhelm an admittedly weak Democrat candidate and platform. Now, Republican congressmen are using a weak, yet egotistical executive to pass destructive legislation that would ensure short-term profits for their corporate donors. Their excitement over passing new laws is making them reluctant to support the investigation into Russian ties and corruption rampant in the Trump executive branch. "

"&gt; There is no expectation that the servicer will act in the interest of the consumer... Navient says its public statements encouraging borrowers to contact the company didn‚Äôt mean it would act in their best interest.

So, pardon in advance for the vulgar language, but why the fuck is this OK? From any company?

I'm getting real damn sick and tired of ""what the big print gives, the spidery print takes away"" and how we're all just supposed to be OK with this, as if this is how the world works or some crap.

If your public advertising--especially, but not limited to, when administering a service on behalf of the government--explicitly says ""call us and we will help you,"" your company should not then be able to turn around and say ""well, caveat emptor for calling us, sucker."" Meanwhile, the handful of agencies devoted to trying to help the individual get any kind of a fair shake from the company ""provider"" that massively outguns any one individual customer, are all under attack from all sides as being ""too heavy handed."" (I love the CFPB, in case you can't tell.)

Oh, and this whole ""consumer"" crap? I'm not a ""consumer,"" I'm a customer. I'm not consuming anything from a financial services provider, I'm using their services.

"&gt; If the universe is constantly expanding, what is it expanding into?

The current theory is that Dark Energy produces a negative energy that causes the space between things to expand.  Your question implies the ""edges of the Universe"" are expanding through some stationary background, but that's not what happens.  All parts of the Universe are relatively stationary with respect to their surroundings.

&gt; If it is a vacuum, what is outside of that vacuum?

During the Big Bang, we think there was a period of Cosmic Inflation, during which the Universe rapidly grew by a factor of 10^26 (a hundred trillion trillion).  If the edge of the Universe exists, it is so far away we can never reach it, the heat death of the Universe would happen first.  This puts your question in the realm of philosophy, because we can never get any observable data to answer it.

&gt; If there are countless universes, as the multiverse theory would suggest, what is outside of them?

There are two kinds of multiple universes: those separated by space, and those separated by dimensions.  One version of the inflationary theory holds that inflation never stops, you just get some bubbles sometimes, which we call Universes.  In that case, the answer is an infinite amount of high energy inflating stuff is outside of Universes.  But each Universe is so large individually, you can never traverse them to reach the edge of the bubble.

Another theory holds that nature is actually 11-dimensional, with most of the dimensions rolled up into tiny balls due to our low-energy state.  When the Universe inflated, it could have done so in multiple ways, with different sets of dimensions growing, and others remaining small.  Those other Universes could be right here, just perpendicular to our three space dimensions and one time dimension.  We don't possess the energy to rotate ourselves into these other directions, so we are trapped in our Universe.  These other Universes can have observable effects on ours.  This puts them in the realm of science and not philosophy.

&gt;  If the answer is nothingness, what does this nothingness look like?

Close your eyes.

&gt; How can something go on forever, with nothing outside of it?

What's infinity +1?  That is mathematically the same as your question.

"Hmm. Xero is pretty intuitive, but you said it was too expensive.

If it's truly a problem, I would bite the bullet and solve it with one of those services.

"* Using one poll to denote 7% (and rising) of Kippers regret the Brexit vote is breaking Curtice law of polling analysis #1: Don't use one poll to ""prove"" a point. 

* The proportion of Ukip voters who regret Brexit has been about 5% since day one. And you can find 5% of any population thinking anything. Outliers always exist.

"&gt; For example, a cream may contain honey, or green tea, etc, but will it ever be enough to actually make a difference?
&gt; 

While most product lines will advertise a few star ingredients like honey or green tea...it has to do with the entire formula. It's very easy to attribute liking a product to its star ingredient, but the fact is that it could be down to the unsexy staples in a cream- the silicones, oils, and basic humectants like glycerin- and the precise balance of oil, water, and extras that really ""does it"" for you.

So if you try, say, a green tea cream, and you LOVE it- that's wonderful! It doesn't *necessarily* mean you can attribute it to the green tea. And it doesn't *necessarily* mean you can extrapolate that and try more  green tea products with the same expectations. You can sometimes discover a magic ingredient that your skin responds well to in everything- that's awesome, but it's not necessary to being a knowledgeable skincare user. 

It's everything- star ingredients, basic ingredients, and personal taste and skin chemistry!"

"&gt; Increases to fuel price alone won't deter people from driving more.

Sure they will, simply because people don't have an unlimited supply of money.  Behaviour is sticky, but at some point, money becomes a factor.

But having other options does mean that less carbon emissions can be achieved *with a lower carbon price*.

Say (for sake of argument), we quadrupled the price of gas in two areas.  One area in which there are poor sidewalks, no walking paths, no transit and so on.  (You get the idea).  The other area has excellent sidewalks, ample (and safe) walking and bike paths and excellent and efficient transit.

The first area isn't going to see as much carbon emissions reduction.  And if you want equal carbon emission reduction the second area doesn't need a carbon price as high as the first.

But of course since the idea is for the carbon price to be equal everywhere, it makes sense from a policy perspective to have a mixed approach rather than relying exclusively on the carbon price."

Except meanwhile an altcoin with some simple deductive reasoning realizes that if Bitcoin can only cater to 0.1% of the world's population, but they can cater to 3% of the world's population, they're going to kill Bitcoin.  And so they do.  Those who followed Bitcoin because Moon will realize that Bitcoin will never reach the moon, $altcoin is going to the moon, and they will jump ship.

You'll be holding a worthless piece of history and they'll be wealthy.  Markets don't care about philosophy, they care about usefulness.

That since they do not use the degree of change for earths shape; that it is not a sphere.

I tested this with Windows 10 in both tablet and desktop mode. This technique would allow two different shortcuts with different names, options and directories, if one wanted to have one click access to the appropriate forked chain.

"The people who run American politics are wealthy enough that this does not pose a significant threat to them.  Their floating ocean cities, and underground hideaways are already built.

In fact it clears the troublesome infection of humanity off the earth's remaining resources, making those resources much more conveniently accessible to the purposes of those wealthy decision makers.

"After living in the same house with someone for the past decade who suffers from massive SAD, one of the many traits i've observed is that he's the most judgemental person i've ever met in my life. He spends every hour of every day worrying so much about what other people might be thinking of him, but then turns around a gossips constantly about the actions and behaviors of all those around him. From my perspective, what he fears most is that every one else is just like he is, not realizing for even a moment, that most of us aren't."
"Impact of Trump's proposed budget for NIH will be to **PREVENT** the awarding of almost all new grants or the continuation of those coming to the end of their term. It will have a dramatic impact on biomedical science in this country and research universities, which depend to a large degree on federal funding. Although, the final budget might not contain cuts of this severity, there may be less severe cuts (which will still have a major impact).

&gt;The N.I.H. awards multiyear grants and contracts, but receives annual appropriations that must be spent that year. This means that at the start of each year most of its dollars are already committed to recipients of awards from prior years. A budget cut of the size that is proposed would effectively prevent the awarding of new grants or the renewal of any that have reached the end of a multiyear commitment. Junior scientists, already struggling in a highly competitive atmosphere, may not get a chance to have an academic career. Senior investigators might need to lay off staff, disrupting research teams and leaving projects unfinished."

This is not a CT of any type, an empty threat, wild accusations, or any such thing.  This was an event which when confirmed based on pure fact, per the chemistry, the physics, the great amount of scientific evidence, which point to and fully supports a different kind of truth along with the corresponding data that destroys the BIG LIE pushed by the MSM.

An independent investigation of 911 MUST happen.

The corporate owned media is just as guilty of this crime as the people that directed the event.  To know the truth, to see a crime being done, and to remain silent, or worse yet, to support the lie in all out effort to conceal, is beyond criminal.

"&gt; We don't have quotas per se but we definitely have had changes in who we accepted

Certainly, but I think that's more due to changes in who chooses to apply to immigrate to Canada, rather than intentional policy changes to shape the countries of origin of our immigrants?

And until the 1960s we actually did have country-based quotas, to prioritize Europeans (or at least Brits) instead of going purely off merit, so the removal of those quotas is likely part of the explanation for the more diverse mix of countries that people immigrate here from now.  And the increased wealth and education in developing countries is likely part of it as well, as well as cheaper/easier access to global travel.  It's a lot cheaper and more convenient to get here from the Philippines than it was in 1920.

&gt;a province like BC have started accepting way, way more students from India.

This is what game-theoretically guarantees that Alice will not publish an out-of-date (though valid) tx. It's clever."

"At the very least indeed, which is still somewhat significant."
Because you get to live in this country and a fundamental priority of any country should be to educate its citizenry; not only because it's the moral thing to do but also because it's absolutely essential for ensuring social mobility and preparing the American workforce for the economy of the future -- something that will ultimately greatly affect you and the society and economy you live in.

"I never said he was. But, neither was Hillary, nor was Obama when he said ""we tortured some folks"" and then didn't do anything to hold anyone accountable. Neither was Bush when he signed the Patriot Act, and started the Iraq war based on CIA lies. Neither was Bill Clinton when he deregulated Wall Street and lied about not having sex ""with that woman"".

 Accountability is what we need, and it's what we've needed for a long time now. At least people are more upset now that Trump's president. Maybe 'we the people' will finally be able to come together in any sort of meaningful way soon.

EDIT: accountability has actually always been the name of the game. Look at what Harry S Truman said about what the CIA was becoming...

""Now, as nearly as I can make out, those fellows in the CIA don't just report on wars and the like, they go out and make their own, and there's nobody to keep track of what they're up to. They spend billions of dollars on stirring up trouble so they'll have something to report on. They've become ... it's become a government all of its own and all secret. They don't have to account to anybody.

That's a very dangerous thing in a democratic society, and it's got to be put a stop to. The people have got a right to know what those birds are up to. And if I was back in the White House, people would know. You see, the way a free government works, there's got to be a housecleaning every now and again, and I don't care what branch of the government is involved. Somebody has to keep an eye on things.

And when you can't do any housecleaning because everything that goes on is a damn secret, why, then we're on our way to something the Founding Fathers didn't have in mind. Secrecy and a free, democratic government don't mix. And if what happened at the Bay of Pigs doesn't prove that, I don't know what does. You have got to keep an eye on the military at all times, and it doesn't matter whether it's the birds in the Pentagon or the birds in the CIA.""

"Ahh, I hear ya."
"In certain industries it certainly is. I've _literally_ had a hiring manager toss an older worker's resume in the trash in front of me because ""this guy just wants the company insurance"". "
"I look for stocks that trade at low multiples of EBIT to Enterprise Value and use that as my hunting ground. This is historically the best performing valuation metric.  https://valuestockgeek.com/2017/01/11/what-is-the-best-stock-valuation-ratio/

If you're looking for a great screener, I would use Tobias Carlisle's that looks for the lowest stocks with this multiple: http://acquirersmultiple.com/

Another good source of ideas is Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula screener which you can check out here. Joel's magic formula combines low EBIT/EV with high returns on invested capital. https://www.magicformulainvesting.com/

If you want some good books on the subject I'd recommend the below:

By big market you mean Trump's supporters? LOL! Have you checked his ratings lately?
"Do you market you services locally or do you go wide?  I've wondered about a local marketing agency serving those trades. I'm a 25yr sheet metal tin banger turned web admin but would like to operate a couple or four businesses out of my home office.  I already have a regular day job managing a national parts supply website.  I want to bid on sheet metal work as a sub-contractor and hire mechanics to do the work and I act as project manager.  I would also like to start a marketing agency serving blue collar service companies - for the exact reason you say, because they are straight up hand-shake good to work with."
"Oh wow, I've seen that exact comment written before. I've even heard it spoken! You must be the same person!"

"I think it would only have to be saving around the time of interactions, the whole day is probably not gonna be anything remotely worth saving. A sort of rolling overwrite, disabled by dispatch or being in the area of a dispatched officer, etc. GPS technology will be useful in this regard."
Thanks for your feedback! Much appreciated. I'm also thinking about the connection between the sentences. Really want it to be impactful.
Youts? What's ah yout?!
"No offense, but the Maritimes are no kingmaker. "
Thank you so much! I just never imagined some place like this would exist in NYC! I'm also not familiar with Staten Island either.
"There was a mass walk out at State and then they fired all the ambassadors, effectively at Inauguration.  There is probably a shit ton of malicious compliance going on at State right now and the hammers of foreign governments coming down with demands for immediate clarifications of the statements of The Insane Infant and Pense.

Tillerman has utterly no clue and probably thought all he would have to do is end Russian sanctions and open up Siberia to Exxon.

Idiot.  "
