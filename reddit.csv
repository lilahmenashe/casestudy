"Generally, when the president of a country is on the phone with a representative of one specific news network every night, it smacks of propaganda. News are supposed to keep politicians honest, and report on what is happening. When a news network has a scheduled daily appointment with the president to compare notes on what tomorrow’s story is going to be, it’s not news, it’s propaganda. It’s very clear-cut. 

In this case, it’s even worse. The nation’s biggest news network, which is already known to be the propaganda-arm of the GOP, is literally in bed with a president who is very open to conspiracy theories and generally extremely suggestible. This is not normal. This is not okay. "

"The Establishment Clause has roots in spending money. Indeed, many state constitutions back in the day explicitly set aside revenue to *establish* religious education and whatnot.

It's deeply disturbing that you'd draw such a generous dividing line. So you're saying that so long as religious people don't have an explicitly special say in government, you'd be perfectly fine with the government just handing out money to religious groups for religious stuff all willy-nilly? You know... the people's money, that they give to the government via taxes for the public good?

The USCCB (conference of Catholic Bishops) has letters written to the government regarding the Church’s stance on climate change. My step father claims that the church  has just become too liberal. I tell him he’s just become too brainwashed by the Republican Party to think for himself.  

To be clear, I don’t personally identify as a Republican or Democrat - to me climate change is not a political issue, it’s a fact and every citizen is responsible for doing their part - if that means more regulations, so be it.  My parents accuse me of a being a liberal now though, almost solely because I am a firm believer in climate change.  I bet they’re regretting sending me to all those Catholic schools that taught me everything I know about the Church and it’s political stances :) "

"Sure, when a stock goes public it issues common stock. People like you and I then purchase those common shares. From that share count is a game of supply and demand. Unfortunately, Robinhood doesn’t share info on outstanding share count, so I get my info from TD Ameritrade app. 

Stocks like 
VVPR (13 million shares outstanding / 13 million volume for the day), 
CHEK (1.6 million outstanding),
CLWT (2 million outstanding)
All have low outstanding share counts. The less amount of shares available, the easier it is to swing the stock price by buying/selling. People with deep pockets trigger an uptrend by buying a large amount of shares, starting the “pump”. Once the big fish reach their target gain, they “dump” the shares for a nice profit. People who buy in first are the winners, whereas the people who bought late and try to ride it up could end up being the losers. 

Since the ride up in stock price happens with no news, the stock price never stays at that level for long. In other words, it’s considered a pump and dump."

"Actually that's 'according to one contributor to their magazine in freaking 2001.'

&gt; WASHINGTON - U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed a key assistant of long-time Donald Trump adviser Roger Stone, two people with knowledge of the matter said, the latest sign that Mueller&amp;#039;s investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election is increasingly focusing on Stone.

&gt; In an emailed statement to Reuters on Friday, Stone said he believed that Mueller&amp;#039;s scrutiny on him stemmed from &amp;quot;Misapprehensions and misconceptions&amp;quot; created by the media, and that he would ultimately be exonerated of any alleged wrongdoing.

&gt; Reuters reported earlier this week that FBI agents working for Mueller delivered two subpoenas to Jason Sullivan, a social media and Twitter expert who worked for Stone during the 2016 campaign, and that agents told him Mueller&amp;#039;s team wanted to question him about Stone and WikiLeaks.

When my wife and I bought our house the seller moved out the week after our offer was accepted. So the house was empty. Our realtor took us there with my wife's parents to check it out. Some neighbors told the seller and there was confusion and mixup about why we were there. It created a headache for no reason. I wish we hadn't gone back. It ended up not being a big deal but it could have been. We were back again for inspections at least three more times so there would have been other opportunities to show them. 

Our agent said after that incident that she usually doesn't bring people back if they're already under contract but because he was moved out already she thought it wouldn't be a big deal. It still was. 

Maybe the agent has had an experience like this and prefers not to go back a bunch of times. "

But honestly if you are happy where you are don’t sell if you do want to sell contact a local realtor (a really good one) and ask them to help you sell it.

"There's a great scene from Wolf of Wall Street where Matthew Mcconaughey is talking to Leonardo Dicaprio about how his brokerage firm works.  There's one point in it where he says something to the nature of...

Mcconaughey:  So, you've got a client who bought stock at 8.  And now it's at 16.  And he wants to take his money, liquidate, and run.  But you don't let him do that!  

Well, I kind of imagine that whole scene with Mcconaughey playing a senior Democrat talking to a liberal activist.

Mcconaughey:  So, you've got this black person who says he's a Democrat but is pro-life or something.  And now the Democratic Party decides it's going to push some new abortion bill.  So now he wants to express his individuality and run.  But you don't let him do that!  No.  Instead, you have a brilliant revelation.  An astute observation.  You see an Uncle Tom!  A traitor who dared to think for himself.  And so you smear the shit out of him until he falls back in line.  Revelations, my friend.  And the ferris wheel goes round and round, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  "

might restart a small starter position at 1.80 monday if it hits

"The Pacific Railroad was a railroad based in the U.S. state of Missouri. It was a predecessor of both the Missouri Pacific Railroad and St. Louis\-San Francisco Railway.

The Pacific was chartered by Missouri in 1849 to extend ""from St. Louis to the western boundary of Missouri and thence to the Pacific Ocean.""\[1\] Due to a cholera epidemic in 1849, which was a citywide disaster, and other delays, groundbreaking did not occur until July 4, 1851.

In 1865, it became the first railroad to serve Kansas City, after construction was interrupted by the American Civil War. In 1872, the Pacific Railroad was reorganized as the Missouri Pacific Railway by new investors after a railroad debt crisis"

"Fair enough, I've just heard of strategies that do pretty big drawdowns on risky plays, just to make it back on some huge ones with the money to take advantage of it.

That said, does my comment on the team of smart people hit it on the nose? At least stereotypically, the image of the misguided Technical Analysis professional is the kind of guy that just roughly looks for trends or follows other people's trends without rigorous mathematical analysis (I would imagine someone like Jim Cramer but less smart), which I assume smart funds do not do.

On that note, what's your opinion on TA? It seems like you believe it works institutionally given where you work at, but I'm more inclined to believe that for small-scale, relatively unsophisticated investors, it's more randomness than anything else, and that's what drives people's opinion of TA."
"As I already said, I have experience to offer. That's a thing. I also said that if you have actual studies showing that the police treat nazis and antifa differently, that would be really convincing evidence to back up your assertion. You made a claim that the police treat one side differently than the other with no evidence to back that up. My claim that it's really difficult to be in the position the police are in is backed up by 8 years of my own life doing something that is quite similar. I am 100% confident that a survey of police and military will find broad agreement. So you haven't provided compelling ethos. Saying ""I'm a social scientist"" doesn't imply you have experience, it implies you have studied this maybe even published on it, so I am asking for links because what you said sounds like a guy making a statement based on his own biases about the police and the work they do. So did you say ""I'm a social scientist"" to let me know that you were going to be able to link some information to buttress your argument, or did you say it to lend weight to what is otherwise a generic opinion of an academic? Your comment implied that the military is a bad model for how the police should work because the military operates with impunity and that the police cant wear protective gear to try and separate antifa shit heads from nazi shit heads because it looks scary and that raises the chances of something bad happening. That last part was what I expected links supporting. Surely you must have that based on the way you wrote your reply. There has to be some study showing that it's better for police to risk getting stabbed by skinheads and wannabe anarchists than to wear simply PPE based on what you said, unless you were literally expecting a to think ""this man is a scientist, we cannot question him"". My claim that people wearing protective gear feel safer jives with common sense and my own life experience and that of my closest friends, and doesn't require that. I know what it's like to feel exposed, but have ROEs that make you think, ""jesus, I'm already screwed by the time I can defend myself it will be too late"" my reply was rude because I'm calling your comment bullshit because you claimed to be an authority on the issue by virtue of having studied it, yet provided no studies. My expertise on the matter is life experience. I am willing to yield to you if you can actually back up what you are saying with something other than just a claim that you are a social scientist. Social scientists examine the world by studying it, show me the footwork. "

"Ive heard is that the land which is now the arctic refuge was originally set aside post WW2. This was done because we knew there was oil under the land, and we wanted to save it in case another large war broke out and we needed oil to fight the war. So not only is a refuge being violated by drilling there, but a president who claims to be a supporter of the military and big on national security is allowing private companies to take our military oil reserve and use it for profit. So much hypocrisy."

"&gt; It's as if a patient thinks he's a dog, and part of his treatment would be to put a collar on him and give him a few Milk Bone dog biscuits as a reward for good behavior.  These people have a problem (gender dysphoria), and they are being encouraged by powerful cultural forces in society to mutilate and distort their bodies in trying to become something they can't. Of course, those who are egging them on have their own agenda which is not the best interest of the gender-conflicted. But this is a common tactic of the progressive Left. Causalities on the road to Utopia do not trouble them in the least. As Joe Stalin said, you have the break a few eggs to make an omelet.

"Perhaps the most important excerpt to analyze here is this:

""In the United States, as in most countries, there is an absence of controlling legislation that defines exactly how a person’s gender is determined. (44) The following example demonstrates some of the complexities this may raise. In 1999, the Texas Court of Appeals considered the validity of a marriage between a man and a person born genetically as a man, but surgically altered to have the physical characteristics of a woman. (45) As in most American states, Texas family law prohibits same-sex marriages, and the United States Congress has passed the Defense of Marriage Act that, for federal purposes, defines marriage as a “legal union between one man and one woman”. (46)

Despite the fact that medical experts gave testimony to the effect that the individual in question was psychologically and psychiatrically female before and after the sex reassignment surgery, the court held that chromosome complement, and not sex reassignment surgery, outward gender characteristics, nor psychosocial self-identification, determine a person’s gender. The court invalidated the marriage on the grounds that the transsexual woman was legally a man. (47)""

Medical experts testifying the person is in fact female, psychologically and psychiatrically. Yet the courts allowed a ruling that was inherently anti-science. When science testified they were a female, the courts ruled them legally a man. This is an example of anti-scientific thinking in the same vein as the line of thinking you have put forward to assert gender and sex are one in the same, which they are not. They science of psychology, which actually studies and explores gender, defines gender as a social construct, whereas biology is naturally concerned only with biological sex in many instances."

The second reason was that they thought the common masses were too dumb and might end up electing some demagogue or you could have other countries manipulating people. Thus you have the electoral college whose electors who would never allow the people they represent to end up electing someone totally incompetent and/or controlled by a foreign power...

"I’m on my 4th bottle of Josie Maran Argan spf 47 sunscreen. It does have a white cast to it for 5 mins but it goes away after sinking in, I’m so pale that it really doesn’t bug me but it might for others. It does feel a little greasy when you first put it on but give it 10 mins to settle in and you’re aces. It doesn’t spread easily so I mist my skin first with any aerosol water and then it’s fine. I know this isn’t the greatest sales pitch but I love it! 

I’d like to experiment with other sunscreens but I’m just too nervous bc most will break me out. This one agrees fabulously with my skin but I can totally understand how the white cast/greasy feeling for the first few mins could be an issue for people. I’ll be up at the cottage for two months this summer and away from civilization so I should maybe think about experimenting and not worry too much about a possible breakout....

As for body sunscreen I usually just grab whatever the highest spf/waterproof one is on sale. I use a mix of cream and then go over with mist for areas that are hard to reach just in case. Because I’m outside so much in the summer I really need one that’s water/sweat proof. There’s one from my childhood that I’d love to find again, can’t remember what it’s called but it smelled like cream soda freezees. 

Being super strict with applying sunscreen everyday has been a game changer for me, I just wish I had started in my early 20’s! I can’t believe I used to let myself burn so that it would “turn into a tan” UGH!"

"I have dry, acne-prone skin as well and use quite a few different chemical exfoliants. I would suggest starting with an AHA for improving texture and a BHA for minimising breakouts. 

I use CosRX Whitehead Power Liquid, which contains 7% Glycolic Acid (AHA) and CosRX Blackhead Power Liquid, which contains 4% Betaine Salicylate (BHA). 

You might want to start with a lower percentage of AHA, like blxcklst recommended. I went straight for a 10% when I first starting using chemical exfoliants and was fine but cringe thinking back.

There are a lot of recommendations in the sidebar for AHAs and BHAs of all price ranges, including ones you can pick up from the high street rather than ordering online. I'm excited to try Superdrug's new Glycolic range but not until I find out the percentages - built up quite a tolerance now!

Hope this helps :) "

"Aren’t we going on almost ten yrs without a recession, though? I think there is like a 70 percent chance of recession before 2020."
"Straight up murder isn't a terror attack. I was specifically talking about mass shootings and terror attacks (which are basically the same thing with different motive). Murder rates in the U.S. are higher than Europe, but that is due to *many* causes, not just (though not excluding) the abundance of firearms. The situation in the U.S. is complicated. It is *far* more stressful to live in the U.S. than it is in Europe. Healthcare is more expensive and so is education. That combined with multiple other factors causes a much more stressed out populace (*especially* young people) and you get a society where more people are prone to violent outbursts that may lead to higher murder rates. That's compared to Europe though. Plenty of countries with no right to own a firearm have even bigger problems. The US's problems cannot be narrowed down to ""guns"", and it's much safer to live in the US now than it was 50 years ago. The popularization of mass shootings I blame entirely on the Media. They get covered so much that it gives some twisted individuals the idea that they will get loads of publicity if they pull off a mass shooting (and publicity they get). The murder rate though isn't tied to the growth of the news and social medias, that's down to the core of how the American society is built, and how it's failing it's people in some areas. That won't get fixed by banning guns. *Maybe* you'll see *some* drop in gun related deaths, but keep in mind, most of those firearm assaults are perpetrated with illegally acquired firearms, not by legal owners. You'd cut down on crimes of passion and home intruders being killed, but aside from that, you'd still have a murder problem. Criminals will be criminals. Whether they use a knife or gun to kill someone is irrelevant, that person is still dead."

And how quickly do you think this will get leaked to the press? I'm taking 2 mooches, anyone care to bid? 

You can take this story 2 ways. The first is that there is insufficient evidence against Manafort to win and they are doing this to gather more evidence using the courts to get to Trump. I highly doubt this scenario but I'm sure that's what MAGA's are going to say. 2. The judge is full on MAGA. Remember how much Republicans moaned and whined about Judges being ""activists"" bet they won't say shit now. 

In any case this is now a peculiar situation. Mueller must know that if he gives a full un-redacted statement it's going to get leaked either to the press or to Trump and his legal team, so what does he do? Drop the case or keep pursuing it? "

Just think of it like this: if you had permanent high interest rates, job growth would grind to a halt, house prices would fall, and all credit costs would increase on consumers preventing them from pursuing their interests (starting a small business, getting a mortgage for their home, etc.)

Also, pro tip: there's nothing stopping you from buying stocks and benefiting from these buybacks."

"I am not disagreeing with you. I am telling you that they literally are being hired by the government we both live under to violate us for the perception of protecting rich/white people. 

I was stopped at the two train, by a cop who had his hand on his gun. He had several other cops behind him, this is at Penn. Dude ask me what is in my jacket. I am wearing a puff coat, and I used to be very fat. When I tell him nothing respectfully, he asks if I have a gun. 

I now raise my voice and say no loudly, and go to unzip my coat, to which his partner comes in and stop him from what seemed to be his attempt to unholster his firearm. The same cop with his hand on his gun tells me to keep my voice low. That is when his partner says ""Nah it's not him"" and backs off and backs the cop off of me. 

One was trained well the other wasn't. I remember when Eric Garner and De Blasio tried to take a stand. I always think back what if the other cop didn't call that guy off. And I remember Cuomo left de Blasio to hang. He allowed to cops to act as if they were the victims. 

If the State and city treated that animal Daniel Pantaleo like a criminal as he should have been, the abuse would end. But scummy politicians live on demagoguery. I am not saying they aren't bad cops, I am saying politicians like Cuomo live and breathe that type of officer for their poll numbers. 

They like bad cops to keep certain neighborhoods depressed, and to hurt certain demos without power. That is what police abuse is about, making show the black, brown, and broke unwanted in cities like New York never leave their areas.

"It sounds like what you want to do is lease the space. You can't sell it to someone, and take it back if it benefits you later. If you are even thinking of selling the condo in the near future, I wouldn't separate it from the deed. You probably need to start with the condo association, to find out if you can even do this. I wouldn't be surprised if they had bylaws preventing it. 

Even if it is allowed, I wouldn't do it. Lease the space (you have to check and see if this is allowed) for whatever term you think is appropriate (6months, 1 year, 4 years, etc.). I would have a lawyer draft a lease similar to a residential rental agreement, that outlines specifically what the space can and can't be used for, what occurs in the event of non-payment or breaking terms of the lease, how much is paid and when. 

Even if you don't use the space, or most people in your building/city don't have cars, you will put your condo at a major disadvantage come selling time if all the other condos come with parking spots. What of you get visitors from out of town? What if your situation changes and you need to get a vehicle? 

Tldr: check the bylaws of whatever authoritarian regime oversees your building to figure out what options you have, if any. Don't sell, lease it. "

"I've got a user experience report for you, hope it helps:

- I created a new wallet, and thought this process was similar to other bitcoin apps and intuitive/acceptable. On a side note, I'm sure you won't listen to this advice but I personally dislike the common procedure where wallet apps force users to take security precautions by making them write down the multi word seed and then type it back in. I think wallets should give people an option to be idiots: automatically prepare a text file for them with their seed words and open up the ""share"" screen so they can email that file to themselves. I encourage you to embrace the idea of giving people the option to use terrible security if they are lazy idiots or just testers. We testers in particular don't like jumping through hoops when we're not going to keep this address or store anything of value in it.

- I like that it gives you basic instructions with step by step buttons for how to get started. Also, I think there should be an option to get rid of this getting-started interface once you're done getting started. For someone who already has bitcoins in the app, they'll probably want their main screen to show them their lightning balance and give them tools to manage it, with a button to let them look at their onchain balance and manage that. (I also appreciate your decision to speak of these balances as a checking account and a savings account, which is quite intuitive, though I personally think we should gradually -- eventually -- get people used to referring to these things as addresses and wallets instead of accounts. For advanced users especially I think ""lightning balance"" and ""onchain balance"" are more appropriate descriptions than checking account and savings account.)

- Even though I like the basic instructions, they largely didn't work for me. The first step was to wait for syncing -- this was fine, though I noticed that when I got off wifi on my trip home and reconnected at home, the app got stuck syncing and I had to restart it. There's a possible bug somewhere in there.

- The next step was to receive test coins. I successfully and easily copy-pasted my pubkey into the field on the faucet page -- so far so good. The fields for channel amount and initial balance confused me -- I was like, ""My channel amount is currently zero. Is it asking how much I want to receive?"" I decided to type in the number 100,000 because that's what was greyed out in the field as if it was expected or some kind of default. Later I saw that there's an instruction in your app underneath the link to the faucet where you say to use an amount that is over 250,000 -- I think that instruction should be clearly visible before the user taps the link, because I didn't see it until later and if I missed it, I'm sure other people will as well. Then with the second field I was like ""initial balance, that's obviously zero, because that's how much I'm starting out with."" But it wouldn't take zero as an option so I typed in the recommended one -- 50,000. I still don't know exactly what these fields mean, and confusion is not something you want for your users, so perhaps some more explanatory instructions would be advisable for this part. Anyway -- after getting amounts in there that the page's javascript error-correcter accepted as valid, I hit the submit button, whereupon the page tried to establish a connection to somewhere and timed out. I tried this repeatedly and it kept timing out -- I haven't yet gotten it to work, so that counts as a bad user experience. Likely user error -- but perhaps it is an opportunity for user-education on your part so that others don't have a bad user experience.

- I went down to the ""savings account"" card next and decided it might be good to get some testnet coins into my onchain balance through a trusty onchain transaction. There are no instructions in your app for receiving testnet coins via an onchain transaction, but I didn't really expect any instructions because that's not what this app is about and also I already know how. Getting those testnet coins into the app worked just fine though -- no problems there. 

- After I had some testnet coins in the app I tried to transfer them to my lightning balance (i.e. ""checking account""). I tried ""open channel to an existing peer"" because it sounded simple, but there seems to be a bug -- the screen turns white, a ""cancel"" button briefly appears but then goes away within a half of a second, and the interface remains completely white with no buttons or anything -- just empty white space from the top of the screen to the bottom. So I hit the back button, which unexpectedly minimized the app. After opening it again, I found myself at the homescreen. But I didn't need to resync, so I guess the daemon at least was still running in the background. Very poor user experience here. No matter how many times I try the ""Open channel to an existing peer"" button, that's what happens: white screen, brief appearance of a cancel button for half a second, then permanent white screen, until I hit back or home -- which then seems to restart the interface. Something's going wrong here obviously, but I'm not sure what.

- I decided to try to connect to a lightning node using the qr scanner, so I loaded up acinq's testnet explorer and scanned the qr codes of some well-connected nodes. I mostly kept getting an error message saying that they were not online (even for ones that I highly suspect Are in fact online, such as Endurance), but at least once I managed to find one that was online, but, alas, the attempt to establish a connection timed out, and the ""pending open channel count"" remained at zero. This is also a poor user experience and I was at it for about 10 minutes unsuccessfully.

- After all that I went into the ""show network graph nodes"" button and tried to connect to my peers in there. For a long time each peer said a connection could not be established -- and I even made sure I was fully synced by checking the message at the top of the app's homepage, which said I was synced -- but each peer still said a connection could not be made. After typing out most of this post I tried again and, lo and behold, connecting to those guys worked. This too is a poor user experience, though, because establishing these connections does not seem to have an obvious reason why it should not work for a long time and then suddenly work. And I still cannot move anything from my onchain balance to my lightning balance, nor does the faucet page work. So overall it's a very poor user experience, though your user interface is pretty good, and I like its helpful step by step instructions -- even if they didn't work for me and I think there should be a button to get rid of them once the setup is done.

I hope this explanation of my user experience is helpful in finding bugs and improving the app. I'm grateful for your efforts!"

"&gt;she will become a martyr for the left

I'm gonna respectfully disagree here.  She is already a martyr for those who wish her to be. While her odious comments about Bush are bad, her threats to Spencer and citing the hotline number are what we should be focused on.  She should face personal consequences for those actions and if she gets fired so be it.  

Remember the dude at Google who got fired?  Do you think leftists cared that he might become a martyr for the right? No, the dude just got axed and frozen out of the industry. He, and more importantly, others like him, were silenced for fear of losing their job.

If we are afraid of the possibility of martyrdom, there will never be personal consequences for human stains like Jarrar."

That's because of how the MTA wants you to use their API.

Take a look at their data download page:

http://web.mta.info/developers/download.html

&gt; To access real-time arrival estimates of railroad trains, subway trains and buses, or real-time vehicle geographic positions, developers must register and receive an official API key. Please click here to request a key.
&gt;
&gt;As a reminder, use of MTA data to power apps must be hosted on developer servers and not pointed back to MTA servers.

I'd imagine that they want developers to cache the arrival estimates to some degree to reduce the load on the MTA's servers and / or to avoid API keys getting into the wild and needing to be revoked if misused."

"Yes! The home we withdrew our offer on was a gorgeous MCM that they made feel cold and sterile inside. Everything white and the light grey floors, too. The few remaining cabinets that were originally a beautiful walnut (and literally everything else that had been bare wood) were painted white. No sense of style or period. I figured we could bring back some of the warmth by replacing the floors and the granite but they fucked up the structural integrity, too. So sad. "
"I agreed on that part, OP should save up for another year and he probably can get 20% down for a 350k home. At that moment, financially speaking buying a house is most likely better than renting in a 5-year scale.

I don't really get the hot market part. Really it's because it's hot, the increase of the house value in 5-year will likely to outscale the selling cost. And in a seller market, selling the house is not a hassle at all. If it's a cold market, where takes months to sale and potentially sold for under asking price, even with repairs needed to be done, I will most likely recommend OP to rent. Chances are in a hot market like LA, cash buyers are everywhere, houses are sold as is. Again, that depends on the area OP is looking at.

And in comparison, renting prices are often driven up by such markets. Dealing with yearly increasing rent isn't an ideal scenario as well. "

"&gt; Your apathy and hate for poor is seriously weird.

I have no hate for the poor.  I love the poor.  Imagine an entire 80% of society who can not stop spending and daydreaming but they work 40-60 hours a week for $0 net worth growth.  That means that 80% of society grinds themselves to the bone VOLUNTARILY to enrich guys like me.  **I love the poor**.  I want to see them have more ""freedom"" to buy more $200 pairs of sneakers and $30 avocado toast.  Hell, I want to build more hospitals and colleges for them to be distracted with.

&gt; I do not know any rich person who thinks like you.

Do you think the average rich person you know will actually tell you that they're happy you are a poor grunt who enriches them?  Of course not.  I'm one of the few honest people in the world.

&gt; If anything you should use the wealth and resources towards solving the very problems you have highlighted.

Read Pareto.  These are not problems.  This is nature working as nature intended.  I support nature.  You can't ""fix"" what isn't broken.

&gt; You are describing spoilt offsprings of rich people. Who have no money by end of the month despite fat paychecks.

I was in some of the ""poorest"" neighborhoods in America, Africa, and Asia in the past 2 years.  I've seen how much crap the poor people buy with their meager incomes.  They refuse to save because as soon as they see their neighbor buy some plastic bullshit, they want it, too.  Go spend a few weeks on /r/personalfinance and see the number of morons who continue to live like there's no tomorrow.  It's amazing.

&gt; I am squarely referencing to people who are born poor and have little means to get access to simple ladders

You can't fix that.  The market and nature fixes it.  There are millions of powerful people on the planet today who came from dirt poverty 1-2 generations ago.  Millions.

If a poor person wants to be powerful, they have to shit on their people.  Guys like Kanye (who I mentioned) shat on his race and class to become powerful.  He sells those grunts $200 sneakers and $100 perfumes, lol.  Smart fucking guy.

Look at anyone who came out of poverty -- the products they sell are marketed to the poor people to make them think they're not poor.

I love nature.  I love the market.  Bitcoin is just one more weapon for me to build wealth on the backs of the poor who voluntarily stay there."

Next, having an agent can help reduce your liability in case certain property characteristics weren’t disclosed or lied about. Having a good agent means those things are less likely to happen.

I really think you must have gotten absolutely screwed in the past somehow, and you don’t want to admit to yourself you got played because of your own lack of attention to a situation.

As well, you might live in a part of the country where it’s easier to see homes with neighbors, trade deeds, or do whatever needs to happen to exchange property. When it comes to buying and selling $1 million+ homes, however, there is important marketing that needs to happen, and also making sure you pay for somebody who can protect you is super important. 99% of people where I live make sure to use an agent they trust. And they build that trust through not being a moron and making sure to do their research or get a referral.

"&gt; Its the miners that decide on the rules, they vote with hashing power.

History has shown otherwise. If it were the case that miners decide on the rules, Segwit2X would've happened very differently. Covert ASICBoost would be the norm amongst other things. It's not just me saying this either, it's pretty clear that miners don't have as much power as you think, as long as you have a secondary consensus layer: nodes.

&gt; Theoretically: What possible method of recourse would an army of non-mining nodes have against miners if they changed the consensus rules? A big fat zero. Nothing.

The rules wouldn't be in consensus if the majority of nodes don't agree with it. The entire point of having nodes is for NETWORK CONSENSUS. Miners are NOT to be trusted. If 90% of hashing power diverted to 32MB blocks, then my node would point to the 10%, because I want to run my own node to validate my own transactions, and I don't have the hardware to use the 32MB block. The fact that BCH took 20% of hashing power and is running majority of nodes through Hangzhou Alibaba cloud demonstrates that the community doesn't want it. That's the recourse.

&gt;If there were any need to download a copy of the ledger up to a certain block number there is no reason not to do it from a miner. 

I can name plenty of reasons. The miner's interests are not my own best interest. I don't know what rules they're following. I want to have a say in the consensus rules, so I can verify my own transactions without delegating trust to a miner. This system is all about trust minimisation, and trusting miners defeats the whole purporse.

&gt; Non-mining nodes are an abomination, never mentioned in the white paper, a relic from when the miners abandoned CPU mining and upgraded to GPU mining. They only cause the network to slow down through slowing down block propagation between miners (which is why all pools/miners connect directly to each other so they can spare spending bandwidth and processing time talking to non-mining nodes). Pools/miners connected to non-mining nodes only face an increased chance of mining orphaned blocks. I have no idea where the idea that non-mining nodes had any goal or purpose began.

Oh my, I think you have to reconsider this because you're working off the premise that nodes are worthless, while in actuality, they're a key part of the system."

"**Deflation**

In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). Inflation reduces the value of currency over time, but deflation increases it. This allows one to buy more goods and services than before with the same amount of currency.

"A lot of your logic is entirely right, and I have invested in a leveraged MF loan like this too. 

First of all, MF's don't perform ""better"" than ETF's. Anybody who says otherwise is taking the best apples and all of the oranges. 

I personally like some MF exposure for two main reasons: lower risk MFs, alternative strategies and leverage (loans are no margin call as you mentioned). Higher asset levels also tend to allow fee rebates to semi-ETF type levels (higher fee ETF's of course). 

They are undeniably higher fee, and vary substantially in strategy, risk and thus returns. 

In your instance, I would advise weighing fees with your decision. The interest rate is entirely tax deductable (as it is interest only) but the MF fees are truly money out. Unavoidable costs for sure, but you can still limit the fees. The ones you named look to be fairly expensive, for both what they provide and the market. B2B bank provides the investment loan itself, and pretty much every MF company has access to to the same thing (loan wise). Shop around a bit. 

At the end of the day leverage strategies simply amplify your returns (good and bad). If you truly don't need to draw on the funds for 10 years (and then some) you will likely still come out ahead with this fund combo. Its just how much ahead is the question, and if you need to draw early for any reason, you will likely lose a decent chunk. Shop around and do some more research before trying this. "
"The current scenario is a special situation where SEBI recategorised mutual fund categories. But yeah a mutual fund is free to change its ""mandate"", but consumers will give be notified early enough.

This mandate and what a fund is supposed to do regarding its investment strategies is mentioned in its SID (Scheme Information Document). You can find SIDs on respective mutual funds websites. 

All these might seem overwhelming in the beginning, but it won't take more than couple of hours/days once you start. It is your hard earned money so make sure you do research and understand as much as possible before committing. "

"Buying a property based on the expectation of appreciation is not investing as people her think of it, it's speculation. When most people talk about REI in the long term they usually mean one of three things. Either they're buying a property that cash flows every single month enough to make it worth holding onto forever, fixing it up so it qualifies for traditional financing, or improving the management of a commercial asset so it's worth more to an investor.

Buying a property with ongoing expenses that does not have a good return on betting your money on factors outside your control like appreciation is a good way to lose your shirt or become bitter over time."

"&gt; ""if you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don’t really have anything that has produced anything. You’re just hoping the next guy pays more.""

That's true.  Just as it's true for gold, art, collectibles, etc.  It's true it doesn't produce anything, but that doesn't automatically make it a bad investment.

Warren Buffett is someone who has done very well following a strategy of understanding businesses and their potential.  Outside of that scope, he personally doesn't like speculative investments that don't produce something of value, and acknowledges that he doesn't understand new technology and mostly avoids it for that reason.  Cryptocurrencies combines both of those things he doesn't understand or like, so of course he hates it.

Now, it's perfectly reasonable to argue that the price of Bitcoin is a speculative bubble.  That's fine.  But anyone who really understand what cryptocurrency is understands that the technology behind it (the ability to digitally exchange something of value with a third party in a completely decentralized way) is *revolutionary* and most financial leaders are at least acknowledging that there is a strong possibility blockchain-like systems will likely replace most of the world's current financial systems because there is no question that it is a better solution than what we are doing today. 

The problem is Warren Buffett doesn't even understand what it is or why industries are considering using.  He has absolutely no understand of it on any level and has made no effort to educate himself about why major industry leaders see value in it.  So he probably isn't the best person to look to for guidance on the value of digital currencies."

"I'm new to algorithmic trading, but there's a lot of resources out there (courses, books, etc) on trading algorithms.

"I'm convinced that Kim Jung-Un has realized that there aren't very many futures in which he stays alive.  His people are starving.  The country has no economy.  China, with the newly minted Xi regime, has taken a hard line with them and Trump is even harder.  Kim must realize that to stay closed off is suicide, for his people and for himself.  The risk of a coup or other revolution raises every day and the new leaders would not leave him alive.  Opening his country up is the only solution where he lives.  "
Not a single serious comment here. 
"A whole bunch of them are unconstitutional due to the commerce clause’s limitations on congressional power

“to regulate commerce ... among the several states”.

This should mean that congress can regulate interstate commerce, but generally not non-commercial or intrastate activity. 

SCOTUS has misinterpreted and effectively nullified the commerce clause through its decisions in Wickard and Raich, which held that anything can be regulated by congress so long as, if everyone in the country did it, some interstate transaction might be affected. 

Can Congress ban growing weed in your own yard for your own use if your state allows it? Rationally no, that’s not interstate and it’s not commerce. But SCOTUS says yes, because if you grow your own weed, maybe you won’t buy illegal weed from another state, and if a bunch of people did it, maybe the price of that latter interstate weed would go down. Therefore Congress can ban home growing of a plant. 

Same thing goes for machine guns btw. The MG ban was actually struck down in the NINTH CIRCUIT before SCOTUS reversed in light of the marijuana case above ^. "

"I’m going to ask you to suspend disbelief for the purpose of engaging in this conversation. The notion of killing power as the litmus test for self defense is a strange arbiter of correctness. The reasons for this are that a person is equally dead by whatever means they are killed. They are not more-dead because the tool used to kill them was an AR-15 than if they were shot by a Saturday Night Special or stabbed with a butter knife. 

What I think you’re focusing on is indiscriminate killing—especially of lives we would all agree are innocent. I purposely chose to include the last statement because I can imagine where some folks might be okay with indiscriminate killing of persons they deemed “evil,” but I do not believe you or I fall into that category. Since it’s the indiscriminate killing you are hoping to reduce (which I completely agree with, except as it relates to your solution), I’m struggling to see how you landed on “assault weapons” as the obvious solution. In the last 20 years, we’ve seen people use cars, knives, homemade bombs, and planes used to perpetrate mass violence at a rate far more deadly than the data offers from the use of rifles. In fact, the gruesome body count for ALL school shootings combined in America since 2000 is hovering around 250. (Before you say that you want to see that number drop, I’m going to stop you and say that all of us want to see that number drop.)

Circling back to your litmus test of demonstrated killing power, the data just doesn’t bear out that modern sporting rifles are being used to indiscriminately kill large numbers of people. In fact, quite the opposite has been borne out of the data we have. Given the staggering number of privately-owned firearms in America, isn’t it awe-inspiring to stop and think that so many people could possess a tool designed for an obviously lethal purpose has led to so few deaths? This very lack of violence at the hands of so many privately-owned guns says at least as much about how law-abiding and focused on public safety the gun owning public truly is. If even 1% of gun owners were as bent on death and destruction as someone as deranged as Nick Cruz was, we would see something on the order of 15 - 20 million firearm deaths in a single year. This is staggering when you consider the reverse. The fact that we are talking about 12,000 - 15,000 firearm murder/year (many of which are wholly gang-related) directly suggests that gun owners do NOT want to see/perpetrate violence. 

Even by the most conservative estimates of 250,000,000 million privately-owned guns in our country, each of those guns is responsible for not more than 0.00006% of the gun murders. By spirited estimates, this number may be as low as 0.00003%. Either way, it clearly demonstrates how mentally stable gun owners truly are. (I can walk you through how I arrived at these numbers, if you wish)

As a final thought, if Nick Cruz were not deranged; if he were a typical gun owner, then he would not have behaved in such a terrifying manner. As it is, we now know that he waited and planned to exact a terrible price against his peers. In conclusion, Nick Cruz will be personally responsible for 0.0011% of ALL gun homicides in 2018, assuming the same total number of gun murders as the last few years. This means he was more than 18 times more dangerous than your typical gun owner. Please don’t punish me—and others—for the deranged actions of someone we can clearly see is at 18 times more dangerous than me. "

"Question out of interest: Any Bitcoin Millionaire around who decided for a Ferrari, Bugatti, Maserati or McLaren (and be it for the purpose of hiding his/her Bitcoin-""millionairness"")"
mcafee is a lunatic he needs to stay away from crypto. give it a bad name
"We are not misleading people at all. We make it very clear using tickers which cryptocurrency is which, and we make the exact same amount (2.5% of the amount) when a user purchases BCH as we do when they purchase BTC.

It is our view that Bitcoin has been crippled by 'second-layer scaling solutions' which do little to actually address the situation of high fees and full blocks. This in turn is detrimental to adoption and reduces the use cases of Bitcoin, particularly as a fast, cheap method of transferring value.

It's not enough to have low fees and quick transactions _some_ of the time, which only _some_ people can afford. Bitcoin Cash brings Bitcoin back to what it should be (particularly compared to a soluiton like the Lightning Network) - peer to peer electronic cash with instant transfers which cost virtually nothing.


Speaking as someone who has been in the Bitcoin space since 2011 I **love** Bitcoin. I've breathed Bitcoin since the very first minute I found out about it, and I've been absolutely in love with it since! It's absolutely world changing and I wish that no hard fork had been necessary, but it was necessary. Bitcoin has been morphed into a settlement layer by vested interests, namely Blockstream, with a lot to gain financially by doing so.

I'm not here to beat down on Bitcoin at all. It's just not the Bitcoin that I've put everything into over the past 7 years, and its promise has been dulled under the chains of 'second-layer solutions'. We're promoting something that we believe is the right option to returning Bitcoin to its original use case; peer-to-peer peer to peer electronic cash with instant transfers which cost virtually nothing, available to all.

Lots of people will disagree with that and that's absolutely fine, in fact it should be encouraged! That's the beauty of open source development and the free market at work. We need to let the markets decide over time which cryptocurrency has the most utility. In 5 years time that might be neither Bitcoin nor Bitcoin Cash, it might be something else entirely, but we should all be working towards making whichever version of Bitcoin we believe in the absolute best that it can be. To me, full blocks, high fees and centralisation in the form of the Lightning Network just doesn't fit with my view of what Bitcoin is and what it should be going forward, that's all."

&gt; Investing it to get best returns is the objective

---

No.

The path to poverty is paved with intentions to get highest returns.

Because high returns come with high risks, and higher the risk, higher the variance in returns - you could actually end up losing money.

Smaller losses can wipe out larger gains. It takes 50% loss (10 to 5), to wipe out a gain of 100% (5 to 10).

Always focus on loss aversion.

Better to miss an opportunity, than taking a risk that can potentially leave you penniless.

You just have to focus on your goals - how much money you need to get to an amount and the timeframe; and take only the risk you absolutely need to take.

If that means seeing others make higher returns than you - then so be it.

---

&gt; Only big expense in near future (4years) is his sister's marriage *Need it in next 4 years *No debts

---

So, you (or whom you are representing), have a goal coming up in 4 years.

Since goal is only 4 years away; I won't recommend equity in your holdings.

Go with debt component in your folio.

Look at some low-duration / UST bond funds.

You should avoid interest rate risk, but maybe you can take some credit risk (it's ok if you don't know these terms - read up on debt funds, you'd understand. Start [here](https://eightytwentyinvestor.com/2016/03/14/debt-mutual-funds-what-returns-to-expect/)).

My suggestion would be to invest 15-20k per month like this:

- [Franklin UST Bond Fund (Direct Plan, Growth Scheme)](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/newsnapshot.asp?schemecode=16854) : 5k / month
- [Aditya Birla Sun Life Savings Fund (Direct Plan, Growth Scheme)](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/newsnapshot.asp?schemecode=15922) 5k / month
- [DSPBR Liquidity Fund (Direct Plan, Growth Scheme)](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/funds/newsnapshot.asp?schemecode=16111) 5k/month

Rest, whatever's remaining, can be invested in these three funds, in same proportion.

To take more risk, in increasing order of risk exposure

- invest more in the Franklin UST bond fund.
- not invest in the Axis Liquid fund.
- add an arbitrage fund.
- add an equity savings fund.
- add a balanced fund.

These might increase your returns, but can also give you surprises. 

From what I've recommended above; returns would depend on RBI interest rates. Based on current interest rates; you can expect 6-6.5%  returns from this folio.

15k/month for 4 years can reach 8.2L at 6.5% compounded annual return. Adjusted for inflation, it's about 5L in today's value.

Also read up on taxation in debt funds, to reduce taxes on your gains.

---

Invest only in direct plans. Otherwise, returns would be lower, because the distributor would take a cut in your gains.

You can use websites of the fund houses, or MFUtility, or Kuvera - for free direct plans.

Do not use Scripbox, FundsIndia, or your bank - they offer only regular plans.

I'm no financial advisor, and you should first study these funds to understand what you're getting into."

"Yes, if you did not sign a contract with a listing agent then you can save the cost of having them represent you. The buyers agent will present you with a contract. Read it multiple times before signing. Who is paying for the title policy? How long to close? Earnest money? Option money/period, inspectons, surveys, home owners policy, What happens when the inspection shows you have a number of items not up to today’s code and they demand you fix these in 15 days or they are walking away? Do the buyers have a letter from the bank saying they can afford your home (are they pre qualified?) This is just a small sample of the question you will need to answer or ask before your house will close.  It’s not easy but can be done and you will save some money. Google “how to sell your own home in (your state)” and that should help as well. Lastly if this does fall through then what?  Hopefully the agent your talking to holds no ill will or you will need to find a new agent. Good luck on the sale of your house.

"100% agree with first paragraph

&gt;""Putin’s been placing his military footprint on key real estate there and elsewhere though (Georgia, Ukraine, etc).""

yes, and there's not really anything we can do about it unless we want to declare war on Russia. we are not the world police as people want us to be. we cannot protect every country facing a threat. we have much more important issues and a crumbling infrastructure, we have kids going hungry, in America.

I have some of the same concern you have, about Putin and leverage over Trump. but so far, there is more evidence of other nations having much more leverage over our entire government, causing much worse results. the focus on Russia I think is over exaggerated because and the prime example of hypocrisy from the US because we are already doing the most despicable things because our government is bought by other dictators

it would not be as annoying and wouldn't piss me off as much, if we got equal reporting on Trump-Russia as well as Israel, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and everything else. this selective outrage from the media is dangerous and sad to me, because it's making the American public focus on the wrong things. whatever connection Trump may or may not have with Russia is affecting average Americans a lot less than proven connections between Saudis/Turks/Israel and our entire government. we aren't wasting 38 billion dollars of taxpayer money giving aide to Russia to kill Ukrainians, but we are doing that with Israel and Palestine. THAT is much more important to the average American than this Russia shit. as well as deregulation of Wall Street, failing healthcare system, both parties being almost entirely corrupt, etc"

"There’s nothing wrong with core if used to describe a software program.

What triggers people is when core and cash are used by the bcash marketing machine to make it seem like these are two flavors of the same brand, which they are not. Bitcoin is sound money, while bcash is a coin issued by Bitmain in Beijing. For Bitmain, bcash is a coin that doesn’t cause as much friction with the Chinese government as bitcoin does. To get bcash on top, bitcoin must die.

"Mainstream publicity on the massive profits due from bitcoin's halving will cause a run on gold, real estate, and stock. Draining of savings. Maxing of credit. So to hitch a ride on the Bitcoin juggernaut. All well before the 2020 halving. 

The legacy system collapses. The dollar dies. Bitcoin fails to reach $1m because the measurement no longer exists.  

1 Bitcoin will never be valued @ US$1m"

"If you have a lot of veggie waste, contact your local small animal shelter or pet shop and see if they would be interested in veggie scraps as a treat for their animals.  

Don't compost animal product waste or carnivore/omnivore/human feces unless you have a large compost that gets to the right temperatures to kill harmful things.  Composting is an art that requires the right combination of ingredients, temperature, and moisture, and is super interesting, but can be really stinky, especially if things go wrong, so I don't recommend doing it indoors, especially in a small apartment.  

Another interesting option is to get mealworms and use that for veggie scraps.  The bonus is you can then eat the mealworms and they are a great source of protein and taste nutty.  

My favorite method is to have pet rats and give them any leftover human food that would normally go to waste.  They have almost the exact same nutritional needs as humans.  It's not super great for the environment, but they pay you back in cuddles.  "

"I would buy properties that make sense in any market. My brother bought a house in the absolute peak of the central Ohio market (April 2007). It has made a solid $300/month cashflow since he bought it and rented it out the first time in May or June that same year. Although I've bought many better deals than that one, in this market with my knowledge base I likely wouldn't turn down an identical deal."
"They're lending you money, they want to be paid back. They look at a lot of things to judge how likely that is to happen. Someone could get fired any time but if they've been employable for 10 years straight they'll likely get another job, so they're still low risk."

I found this thread from 4 years ago.  It feels like we could be having this conversation today under our current circumstances.  Similar FUD, concerns and hopes.  I really think 4 years from now people will be looking back on our threads and wishing they had a chance to get on board the bitcoin train in 2018 when the price dipped.

As an American living in the U.K I hope he does not come in July mostly because I won't be there and I am sure as hell be there if he comes to london the brits liberals are vicious if trump was thickskinned I would worry about him causing a scene but its trump so it would be amazing.

1) Can asset allocation percentages and graphs/charts be made available at goal level instead of portfolio level? I have my emergency funds, retirement funds and educational funds all with Kuvera and showing a single Debt-Equity percentage for my entire portfolio is not very useful to me.

"&gt;I’ve stated my point

... I wanted to start over

Ok so you believe anyone who claims trump belittled disabled people to be doing so in bad faith? You have to acknowledge that even just his words today, that may not have been nearly as obvious as you think. Even if one dove into it, I don’t think it’s as clear as you think. But if I did not know of the man I would given him the benefit of the doubt- so he was busy. 

Even giving him the benefit of the doubt it would have to be pointed out he’s a terrible communicator. Neither here nor there. 

But griping about common redditors (not journalists) concluding he mocked the disabled seems odd. Because as I’ve stated before:

He’s actually mocked the disabled. It’s on tape. 

And again, listen to him say it. It really could go either way because this man has a public history which I won’t ignore. 

He’s mocked the disabled before. It’s on tape. And it’s bad, if you had someone in your life who suffered from disability you’d be appalled. 

So you think this is a hill to fight on? Trumps shitty communication left him vulnerable. He’s literally done what your saying he didn’t do today in the past. So crocodile tears for him. 

I understand your desire for journalistic integrity. The problem lies with the fact he’s a walking word salad. We have to try and interpret him. And the words “that was tough to watch” have to be bent in order to believe (especially given his history) that this was about scheduling. I wonder how you interpret “that was tough to watch”...

Also no one is watching us. I am not trying to silence you. I have no means to do so. 

“That was tough to watch”

"That's not the official ledger store.  That's just a listing. 

Everyone who is selling that item must sell the item on that listing. &gt; If you look towards the bottom there are 90 other people selling the ledger.

It doesn't sound like amazon did anything wrong unless you specifically bought only from the official ledger account on that listing of 90 people.  

What I am guessing happened is you bought from a third party seller and they were trying to scam and since amazon doesn't personally check items they shipped it to you as they were supposed to.  Remember, amazon only does logistics unless they are also the seller of the item.  Their policies to protect you kick in when buyers report the sellers.

Edit:  actually, you need to go into your actual order and look.  That screen shot says it was sold by ledger official, but that's not who you bought it from necessarily Look at your actual order transaction and see what it says on the transaction log as being the seller. 

If it's ledger official thats' probably a return, if it's not, then it's a scam by the third party seller probably.  (although it could be an honest mistake for that seller too)

BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY CHOSEN TO BELONG TO ANOTHER PARTY.

"It turns out there *was* political meddling in our 2016 Presidential election but not by Russia it was the Obama administration and their systematic subversive campaign of unmasking and leaks with information supplied by the FBI wiretaps that the intelligence community repeatedly denied. This recent story comes as no surprise to literally any objective observer who has been paying attention to the actual facts. These were manufactured charges against Manafort unrelated to the Trump campaign which were being used as gestapo political leverage to attack President Trump. 


A number of these illegal wiretaps, which the intelligence community lied about, were authorized by Rosenstein and approved by the FISA Courts based on the discredited DNC financed dossier that the FBI knew was compromised, the political origin of which was never disclosed to the Courts. Rosenstein recommends firing Comey and then uses that as a pretext for appointing Mueller who only days before was rejected by President Trump to serve again as FBI Director based on ,again, Rosenstein’s recommendation. This is an absurd political witch hunt being orchestrated by the very same amoral political shills who tried to hijack our democratic election in the first place.

"I'm not describing the Chinese Room, though it is accessory to my point. I am specifically pointing out the fact that appearance and function do not equate to identity, i.e. something may appear to us humans as another human while being something else entirely, which may lack conscious experience. This is the p-zombie.

As I've pointed out, I do not believe that consciousness is an epiphenomenon of the human brain but actually an integral part of the universe itself, one which ""turns outwards"" to face the world through ever-increasing complexification of the apertures which make up the sensory apparatus of various organisms. Thus, while I believe wholly that animals are conscious, and that humans might have additonal ""layers"" of consciousness which animals may not (debateable, though perhaps they are underdeveloped), I do not believe that mimicking human complexity is the same as replicating human experience. A robot might be as ""outward facing"" as a rock, in terms of consciousness - it just happens to have the computational power and inputs required to process and output actions which imitate those of a human.

My point about quantum physics was not one of complexity, but indeterminacy. If consciousness is fundamentally indeterminate then we cannot definitely program any robot to perfectly mimic a human in all instances. That is what a p-zombie is - something identical to a human. So while I think p-zombies are apparently possible, they are not literally possible; robots might mimick humans near-perfectly (be ""practical"" p-zombies) but lack the indeterminacy/consciousness to be identical with humans (at least in terms of consciousness). In this sense, I am not commited to the actual possibility of p-zombies so much as using them to illustrate my concern with assuming complexity = consciousness. 

Perhaps I do not believe in p-zombies after all; biological replicas (didn't realise this was the definition) would, to me, just be humans - like clones. I am concerned with things fundamentally different from ourselves i.e. robots, as we know things like ourselves (i.e. ourselves, presumably others) do, in fact, have conscious experiences.

A quick sketch - You have two identical vases. One is filled with water, another with an entirely different substance of the same density. Without looking in the vase, how do you tell the two apart? You must examine the ""stuff"" inside; knocking the vase produces the same sounds due to the identical properties (though different composition) of the two substances. Suppose the vases are sealed - what then? This is the conundrum we face - how to tell apart two apparently identical things, which may ""contain"" different ""cores"", when we do not have access to the inside of the vase, as it were, to others' direct, conscious experience?

I am not unsympathetic to the possibility of robots becoming conscious, and I am by no means claiming that humans are the only conscious beings - that much should be obvious from my statement on panpsychism/animism. In fact, my stance is precisely the opposite; that consciousness resides within everything. The rub is whether that consciousness is ""world/outward-facing"" or not. 

Computation and processing does not necessarily equate to world-facing consciousness; it is merely analogous to it (causation/correlation; here is the Chinese Room, I suppose). Robots might indeed become conscious, and I will probably be one of the first to engage them in philosophical disputes when it looks like they have. What I am concerned with is people uploading their minds on the basis that the simulation is the same as their reality. If we all did this, we might potentially erase human consciousness from existence. 

Perhaps this is simply an intuition I have, but I would rather err on the side of caution when people might end up annihilating their consciousness in favour of a digital simulacrum."

"&gt; Democrats pre-1964 in the south were conservative, so liberals distance themselves from them.

No they weren't.  They were every bit as liberal as the rest of the Democrats.  Just racist as all hell.

There was no point in American history where the parties changed their ideologies.  There was no switch.  The vast majority of southern Democrats that voted against civil rights stayed in the Democrat party.

FDR was a liberal Democrat, and led a party of liberal Democrats.  He was also one of the most dangerous people in our history, and consolidated so much power that we had to create an amendment to keep it from happening again after he died in office.

"(looks at the chart in allgeneralizationsarefalse)

LOL - HuffingtonPost isn't much better than a blog. And a bunch of the others...I'd hardly call The Hill conservative (it's more a bit left of mid-line) and CBS is not conservative. I think the line there is off a bit. And UseLess Today isn't a news source anymore unless you have the attention span of a ferret on speed.

Don't get me wrong - there's crap on both ends of the spectrum, but the balance leans left and a lot of the big names are trading on their past reputations rather than their latter reporting. I used to think better of CNN, but the MH370 black hole escapade and them getting caught staging a protest in London among other staged events, destroyed my trust in them.

The balances on each of your channels will adjust and re-balance as you route payments for other people, so it may be the case that the 0.002 on your existing channel will be shifted back to you, at the expense of 0.002 on another channel shifting away from you (minus fees).

If you're going to open and close a channel after each payment, you're wasting your time on LN as it's less efficient than conducting a regular P2SKH transaction that way."

I hate greasy sun sunscreens and that tell tale 'sunscreen scent' and often avoided it for years, but I freaking love this stuff, I can really lag it on and it dries reasonably quickly to a nice non-greasy finish, and it only has a faint scent to it.

"&gt; Since, in addition to being hypothetical, everything you wrote effectively stipulates that armed civilians are ineffective against armed violent crime, maybe we can dispense with the pretense that more guns equals less crime... but probably not. 

That is perhaps the most twisted way of takin gwhat I said.  The fact that legal carry is banned in most of these places precludes the option for a good guy with a gun from even being allowed there in the first place so you're saying because something is banned it is ineffective and therefore should be done away with.

That is just beyond ridiculous.

&gt;So-called gun free zones have nothing to do with mass shooters; most recently, Pulse had an armed guard,

But nobody in the bar was allowed to be armed and if you're saying the armed guard failed then why is disarming more law abiding people a solution to stopping criminals with guns?

&gt;Las Vegas is crawling with armed guards, 

Were they in the hotel room with the guy?  Just because it doesn't work 100% of the time doesn't mean it isn't still worthwhile in other circumstances.

&gt;Parkland had an armed security guy and so on.

Yeah a cop who refused to do his job and was followed by others who did the same.  And you want to depend on them for your safety?  Feel free but you have no right to dictate that I do as well.

&gt;There are cases like Las Vegas where pro-gun guys do a complete 180, where the event makes them realize the lunacy of having any reliance on armed civilians 

And there are cases like Parkland and Pulse where it is on display that relying on police to protect you is not a guarantee since they according to the SCOTUS have no legal obligation to do so.

&gt;Get real. At least 28 million gun owners - 1 in 5 - abuse substances and probably double or triple that for alcohol, and there is no firewall between gun owners and prescribed psychoactive antidepressants, not to mention mental illness. Given that's at least equal to the population of Texas, I guess we can't act like it's no big deal... but probably not.


That doesn't actually answer my point though.  IF you are complaining that legal carriers are not stopping crimes in places with alcohol you're efectively complaining that people ar enot being less responsible.  Doesn't matter if statistically gun owners drink or do drugs because it is resposnsible law abiding gun carriers that are the topic and they are not the ones who carry in bars or while drunk.

"Very good question! I wish I knew a professional here on reddit I could ping to give you a better answer. You'll have to settle for my 6 year old environmental economics degree knowledge (better than a random joe/jane, still needs to be served with some salt). There's a thousand issues, some of them regional, some of them dependent on country, city, culture. Some big issues you see often: underpaid local employees, lack of safety/health concerns (pesticides, fertilizers), deforestation. Some nuanced but also big common issues: degradation of soil, loss of cultural strains of food (lack of variety, and often reduction of nutrients), disruption of local agricultural economies (into more hierarchical systems that are tied to global food/commodities markets and concentrate wealth ever higher up the chain).

Happy to dive deeper on any of the above, or expand into other points!

Edit: To your point about your uncle. My world view totally includes your uncle, meaning there are huge positives seen with agricultural systems and GMOs. It's about how and where GMOs are economically introduced and produced. 

Edit 2: I should clarify, even if there aren't great examples of the negative impacts of GMO-economics, the left is still making an error. The left thinks the economics is bad, and then they attack the science. Rather like the christian right not liking the metaphysics of evolution, so they attack the science."

While I think Trump might have been the best president for this Job \(in a backwards roundabout way\) I think that's mainly because Trump and Un are similar. the more likely cause is the decline in trade between china and North Korea and even Un see's that if he doesn't make a move his country wont exist in 50 years. But that's just what intuition tells me. I do think North Korea Is a dangerous place to be a leader of because of the constant struggle to keep power from other military people with influence within North Korea.

"bitcoin stops working if the private keys can be compromised.

"I am not advocating the use of a ""paper wallet"". I proposed two alternatives instead: 

1. The use of two virtual machines of which one is disconnected from the network, on a hypervisor that does not run anything else than virtual machines. Security principle: the impossibility to escape from a virtual macine.

2. The use of a laptop or phone and a disconnected signer phone, which communicate signed/unsigned transactions with each other using QR codes. The electrum wallet can do that. Security principle: the impossibility to communicate the seed as a QR code.

These alternatives are, in my opinion, safer than hardware wallets, which in my impression lack a solid and verifiable security principle."

"There are many reasons for the replicability crisis. There's some really great literature on this issue from Science and Technology Studies (STS) scholars, as well as sociologists of science. "
"In April, the federal government took in a record sum of $515 billion in taxes, according to a newly released Congressional Budget Office report. During that time, we spent $297 billion. Yes, you read that correctly: We actually took in more than we spent — a lot more. That $218 billion surplus is, in fact, a new record, beating the previous record set back in 2001 ($190 billion) by $28 billion.

As the Washington Times points out, the surplus surprised CBO analysts, who were predicting about $40 billion less, though some of that has to do with a shift in timing of payments. In its report, the CBO suggest that the unexpectedly high tax revenues was a result of ""stronger-than-expected"" economic growth last year and in early 2018.

""Those payments were mostly related to economic activity in 2017 and may reflect stronger-than-expected income growth in that year,"" reads the summary. ""Part of the strength in receipts also may reflect larger-than-anticipated payments for economic activity in 2018. The reasons for the added revenues will be better understood as more detailed information becomes available later this year.""

While the news for April is good, some of it has to do with ""shifts in the timing of certain payments that otherwise would have been due on a weekend,"" the CBO notes, and we are still behind for Fiscal Year 2018. ""The federal budget deficit was $382 billion for the first seven months of fiscal year 2018, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, $37 billion more than the shortfall recorded during the same period last year,"" the CBO reports. ""Revenues and outlays were higher, by 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively, than they were during the first seven months of fiscal year 2017.""

Here's the section from the new report summarizing the revenues and outlays from April: The federal government realized a surplus of $218 billion in April 2018, CBO estimates—$35 billion larger than the surplus in April 2017.

CBO estimates that receipts in April 2018 totaled $515 billion—$59 billion (or 13 percent) more than those in the same month last year. Individual income and payroll taxes rose by $73 billion (or 20 percent), on net. Nonwithheld payments for those taxes, largely final payments of 2017 taxes, rose by $60 billion. Withholding of individual income and payroll taxes rose by $7 billion (or 4 percent). Withheld taxes rose both because wages and salaries were higher and because April 2018 had one more business day than April 2017. However, those factors were partially offset because the share of wages withheld for taxes was lower, CBO estimates, reflecting the new withholding tables issued in January. Corporate income tax payments declined by $14 billion (or 24 percent).

Total spending in April 2018 was $297 billion, CBO estimates—$24 billion more than the sum in April 2017.

The largest changes in outlays were as follows:

Net interest on the public debt rose by $6 billion (or 21 percent). Social Security benefits rose by $4 billion (or 5 percent). Spending for military programs of the Department of Defense rose by $4 billion (or 11 percent). Medicaid benefits rose by $3 billion (or 10 percent). Spending for other programs and activities increased or decreased by smaller amounts."

"Not a CA, better confirm this opinion with one.

The query is more about how Interest Income from SCSS is taxable. Prior to the budget changes, interest income from SCSS was taxed \(with TDS deducted at source if it was more than 10k\). The tax liability however would go beyond that, since interest from SCSS would be treated as taxable income. So, if a senior citizen was under 30&amp;#37; tax slab, the tax outgo would go beyond the 10&amp;#37; TDS and additional tax would have to be paid on the remaining tax liability.

There isn't clarity on whether this has changed with the new 80TTB exemption; 80TTA was there even before the budget and SCSS wasn't applicable under that to my knowledge.

This is a related question, under the older rules: [https://www.valueresearchonline.com/story/h2\_storyview.asp?str=32513](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/story/h2_storyview.asp?str=32513)

Every day that Bitcoin increases in adoption, the value increases, and the probability of it falling out of favor decreases by virtue of how the market works: as more people become aware of it and its properties, more people will consider a valuable store of value, therefore more people will want to trade for it, therefore it comes closer to being a widespread currency."

It's two transactions. One credit to the savings account and one credit to the chequing account. You don't actually need any signatures since the cheque is made out to you and it's simply a deposit to your account. A good bank should be able to fit both transactions on a single receipt but some might print two.

Fordyce spots (also termed Fordyce granules) are visible sebaceous glands that are present in most individuals. They appear on the genitals and/or on the face and in the mouth. They appear as small, painless, raised, pale, red or white spots or bumps 1 to 3 mm in diameter that may appear on the scrotum, shaft of the penis or on the labia, as well as the inner surface (retromolar mucosa) and vermilion border of the lips of the face. They are not associated with any disease or illness, nor are they infectious but rather they represent a natural occurrence on the body.

"Thanks a lot for the advice, I really do appreciate it. 

I should have definitely posted a description, I was at work and just wanted to quickly show off what I had thus far. 

This product is the result of really about two months of part-time development, I have a ways to go, I told myself I'd commit about a year to it and see where it goes. I agree the screenshots and description need work, that's great advice. 

As for WHY you should use the app, I have a ton of really cool features planned. One of which is the ability to tip other users in the crypto-currency of your choice. This can lead to cross-pollination so to speak, where perhaps you're chatting with someone who's a Monero user but doesn't know much about the Lightning network for example. You could tip that user on the LN, this could lead to both of you learning more about how LN works and further driving adoption. 

I have a feature planned that will allow you to type a phone number  in, tip that phone number with any currency you want, and then that phone number will get a text. Obviously they'll have to sign up (Good for user adoption) but once they do, they'll have access to all their tips. 

This will essentially act as a new way to send crypto, as well as a way to drive user adoption and build a better network. 

This will all happen within a reddit-like setting, where the chats act as a kind of social network hub.

Thanks for the well wishes! I'll be at this for at least a year, so if it doesn't appeal to you yet (which is understandable, it's a very minimum viable product at the moment) check back every so often. "

Nothing new here, but the idea of actually using partially treated sewage to be discharged instead of un-treated sewage to discharge (like it is now) is a decent one.

If CDSL, in its own capacity, or an employee there, can be involved in it - I've no reason to believe anyone else is not.

Like wtf and then you blame Israel ?! How about blaming all the other muslim states around Gaza? There’s no solidarity between each other, instead of blaming Israel for the horrendous conditions, what about all the other states that decide to not help with any ressources apart from crazy Wahhabi mosques and weaponry? We are talking about the fucking Hamas (an openly violent group with radical ideologies!).

150/month out of 4,000 is a 27 month payback period but I'm gonna have the house for 25 years. What's the return on investment? 

Also, I do full cash out refi on my homes so I have no cash left invested. The tenant pays back the 4k and any other capex. I get to take pure profit, so again, I'll do it every time.

"Sweden is a microcosm of the West. The entitlement state is a blind alley we've been rushing head-long down for 50 years. Now, with fertility rates unable to keep up with an aging population, importing workers is the only way to finance the retirees. Problem is, the Europeans are mindlessly importing millions from a culture where productive pursuits are not the main preoccupation of the people. When such a large percentage of your immigrants are either unemployable for lack of skill or simply uninterested in work, they are making no net contribution to society and are in fact a drag, thus accelerating the fiscal nightmare. 

The Swedish answer is to import even more of the same people, culling from the mass those capable and willing to work....and putting the rest on public assistance, where they negate the fiscal contributions of those able to work. It is a collective insanity, born of the arrogance of affluence, an affluence that is rapidly slipping away.

And why are the Muslim immigrants so unprepared and/or uninterested in work? Because their culture emphasizes religious piety, fatalism, and supremacy above all else, even education. How humiliating it is for them to do menial labor, taking orders from the same Kaffirs (non-Muslims) that they are brought up to despise as inferior. Yet, because of an absence of education and technical skills, menial labor is the only work they're qualified for. In the end, most would rather remain idle and collect their welfare, pining for the day in the not-too-distant future when they'll be running Sweden and they can play boss to the hated kaffir."

"Because Israel wants to scrap it. The conservative Jewish vote is important to Republicans, but not nearly so much as the evangelical vote, and [evangelicals tend to back Israel no matter what.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.jpost.com/Opinion/Evangelicals-and-Israel-542875/amp)

Why does Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu want to scrap the deal? Officially: they do not believe Iran can be trusted, and that certain aspects of JCPOA could be stronger. 

Unofficially: to destabilize the Iranian regime. Sanctions have [necrotized Iran’s economy](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/04/12/irans-currency-crisis-brings-it-one-step-closer-to-economic-collapse.html), and destabilized the government. In 2013, one dollar was worth 36,000 rials. Today, it is worth 60,000 rials. (And in 1979, the year of the Iranian revolution, one dollar was worth 70 rials). 

President Rouhani worked hard to secure the JCPOA and sell it to the Iranian as a cure for their economic woes. Though renewed trade did provide a needed stimulus, Iran’s economy continued to falter after the deal. By reneging on JCPOA, the US has humiliated Rouhani, and made the [possibility of a military coup](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/military-coup-iran-180424144510759.html) loom all the larger. If there is a coup, Israel and Saudi Arabia (who has also been against the JCPOA for similar reasons) will be sure to take full advantage of the chaos.

Another possibility is that Iran begins to move forward with a nuclear weapons program if the US pulls out (they might not — the deal is still in force with Britain France China Russia and Germany), which would [give Israel and Saudi Arabia pretext to attack.](http://www.newsweek.com/us-israel-saudi-arabia-leading-world-war-iran-france-says-770728)

Edit: Also want to mention that Trump’s official reason for pulling out is that Iran refused to extend limits on the production of nuclear fuel beyond the year 2030. "

There was a lot of civil conflict in Germany and Austria prior to the German decision to finally pressure Austria and Hungary to go to war. A huge part of the final stages of planning for the Germans was how bad internal politics was becoming. They knew going to war with Russia would either end the civil unrest or allow it to fester enough that the citizenry would no longer have a capacity to fight their own government or demonstrate and organize against it. Hitler used the same strategy to propel nazism into popularity. War back then meant food shortages and the manpower of the people dissolved. It was as much a way to take the minds of the population off the poor social conditions they experienced as it was a genuine act of aggression.
"I don’t go to Cooley, but am attending an unranked “Tier III toilet”.

The law school Cohen graduated from in 1991 is totally irrelevant - the guy passed the same at as any Columbia or NYU grad and has been practicing law for almost 30 years.  You might as well criticize him for going to a crappy elementary school, that’s how relevant where he went to law school is.

People go to low ranked schools for many reasons.  Sometimes, it’s because they have established careers and want to go at night and the bottom ranked school is the only area school with an evening division.  Other times it’s because they don’t want to borrow $150k at 6% to pay for a Tier I school and want to take the generous scholarship offer of a low ranked school.

You absolutely don’t have to go to a high ranked school to be a good Attorney. The classes at all schools are exactly the same, and taught by the same grads from Harvard/Yale/Stanford using the same case books.  

It’s true that a lot of Tier III students don’t graduate (or pass the bar), but that only reflects on those students, not their classmates.  It’s totally irrelevant to me if the people seated next to me in class don’t pass the bar or practice law - as irrelevant as it was in high school when other kids flunked out or didn’t go to college after.  I agree that law schools shouldn’t admit students with sub-150 LSATs because those students are unlikely to pass the bar, but that is irrelevant to whether I can pass the bar or be a good attorney.  Cooley had one of the highest attrition rates in the country, and that’s totally fine - it just has zero effect on the quality of the students that make it through."

I would think we could at least set ""social equality"" as a standard, that you have to believe in equality of races, genders, and all LGBT groups. You should also have to believe in climate change. I don't think I could vote for a candidate of any party who didn't hold to those values.

While we should be open-minded about potential candidates, we should still seek candidates which will properly address America's problems. It would be harmful to vote for someone who wanted to lower taxes on the wealthy, for example, regardless of their party. How comfortable are people in voting for candidates who are anti-immigration, or in favor of fracking like Lamb, or who support abortion restrictions just because they're a Democrat?"

"&gt;CNN is lying again

Yes they're on the air still "
it means that they probably already revised transaction history of the blockchain so that the millions of unclaimed coins are now in their control
"&gt; the users decided Bitcoin is the software code hosted at the **bitcon core repository** right now

This is true.

&gt; what the miners decide to mine is irrelevant and that was demonstrated with UASF.

This is contradicted by what you just stated above. UASF was a different repository with different consensus rules from Bitcoin Core (the rules about activation of new consensus rules are themselves consensus rules). UASF constructs and demonstrates exactly an *exception* to the rule that miners don't decide on their own. Normally, users first adopt a soft fork (like BIP141 in Bitcoin Core) and then miners signal for it and activate it. Both users and miners decide. It goes through only if both users and miners agree. This is good. This is how it should be. A UASF does not do what it is claimed to do. Miners practically get full control over what happens to those naive enough to run UASF software, right down to the ability to appropriate the bitcoins which UASF users transfer, in the cases of new transaction output formats such as with SegWit. That's right, the security of bitcoins sent in new ways through a new soft fork absolutely depends on and assumes that the majority of miners *agree* to such new soft fork rules, otherwise the bitcoins can be transferred somewhere else.

This is so, because if a change to the consensus rules is not properly *agreed to*, the old rules are the legitimate ones (in this case, Bitcoin Core rules). This principle holds in law and other fields. It is a really simple social principle.

Users using UASF in effect give up full control to the miners, even if they delude each other that they do exactly the opposite.

Perhaps you meant to say that a good demonstration of the fact that miners are not in full control over the whole system is the failure of the 2x hard fork (which was never adopted by users)."

Do not trust redfin or especially zillow's auto-estimates. For a more realistic idea of your homes value in your market, check sold listings in your neighborhood for the last 6 months and try to find sold comps for houses that are identical to yours  both in size, layout and condition. Zillow and Redfin doesn't always take into condition when tabulating estimates."

Brownstone is different as it actually refers to the material. It's fairly unique to NY. I've only seen them elsewhere in Glasgow and Edinburgh, although I'm sure there are some other places with them. There are also greystones and limestones.

Edit: lol @ being downvoted. you're incorrectly associating size with term rather than local language with term. if size was indeed the arbiter or whether an un\-detatched home was a townhouse or a rowhome, then small townhouses in New York would universally be called rowhomes. they are not."

"With respect, I'm not sure enslavement *does* constitute making them repay their debt to society, but rather forces them to inflict yet more harm upon society.

Every job done by a prisoner is a job that could be done for a reasonable wage by a free citizen. By having a prisoner do that job, you bypass an important aspect of what companies do for an economy: paying wages that then get spent by consumers, going around and around, being taxed here and there, helping pay for *more* people's wages etc.

Thus, the act of allowing private companies to profit from prison labour is, I would suggest, actually exerting a greater toll on society than simply letting them while away their days.

"Median starting salary for AZ teacher is $36K. Raises per year are less than $500 which doesn't even covers 1\-2&amp;#37; yearly inflation. If you find time and money to continue education and get masters, the raise is only at a fixed $2K. The median is around $42K to give you an idea. This includes a set of all AZ teachers.

Due to low classroom stipends, teachers are pressured to pay a portion of their income to supplement their classrooms. Job stability is shaky. A bad economy \(thanks to states earmarking sales tax to education budget\) leads to district wide layoffs. Not to mention subpar benefits and job stress with juggling students, parents, and administration."
"&gt; The Republic of South Africa isn’t actually a developing country that struggles providing basic social services, tho.

South Africa has [one of the worst public education systems in the world](https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21713858-why-it-bottom-class-south-africa-has-one-worlds-worst-education), according to The Economist. I'm curious on where you traveled in South Africa to get the impression that the country as a whole is very Western; parts of the country are certainly Western and those are the ones that cater to tourists. The problem with analyzing South Africa as a whole is that to paraphrase former president Thaba Mbeki, it's essentially two societies in one country living side by side; a mostly white, Westernized middle class oriented society which props up national economic statistics, and a poor black society which still has no way of accessing the benefits of being a moderately wealthy nation on paper. The legacy of Apartheid is that millions of people were forcibly relocated to areas specifically marked as undesirable places to live, which makes development really hard even if the government wasn't corrupt. When it comes to poaching, the government (which is quite well resourced) has to deal with people from these places where there is little ""modern"" economic activity - not to mention that in the Kruger many if not most poachers come from across the border.

"Sure, just throw the device on a VLAN that isn’t tagged on any other trunk port and send it out, I get it.

Usually they are only up to a week and have restrictions on duration between using the service, but it’s a good step. 

Also, support groups in general are a great resource for just having someone to talk to when it gets too intense, especially since those people have similar experiences and can relate to your situation more intimately than someone over the phone can.

It's pretty awful there, too. But most of Puerto Rico is poor. Alabama has pockets of poverty that are as bad as you'll see anywhere else, but just about everything outside of the largest cities in Puerto Rico is worse than probably like eighty percent of Alabama.

It's funny because Alabama receives a higher ratio of federal dollars received to federal dollars paid than almost any other state. We are a welfare state. One of the reasons for that, currently, is the work of Sen. Richard Shelby and his intense lobbying for the state. Puerto Rico gets no substantive representation and their federal dollars received ratio has been TINY compared to Alabama-- up until they had, you know, a huge fucking hurricane that nearly blew them off the globe.

"That's already the rule in open primary jurisdictions -- you're of course only allowed to vote in one.

This does still allow for some bad-faith manipulation, though. Hypothetically, maybe the Republican nomination is already locked up, so rather than ""waste"" their vote, Republican voters cross over and vote for a weak Democratic candidate, to help their actual preference in the general election. 

Restricting primaries to those who commit to vote in a particular party primary a few months or weeks before the election (i.e. closed primaries) doesn't completely preclude this possibility of bad-faith election manipulation, but it does make it more difficult.

Again, there are advantages and disadvantages to both open and closed systems in terms of holding fair elections."

"On top of my other comment which is likely what happened here -

&gt; if you look on their community board or search twitter for ""Revolut support"", you'll see it's all lies. All everyone does is complain for a lack of service. 

Ill happily vouch for them. I've run tens of thousands of pounds through the platform including individual transactions in the €1000-3000 range. Other than Portugal where mastercard acceptance isn't as universal as elsewhere I've had no major issues using it and support has always been great with minor problems (most of which were well over a year ago - I was a fairly early adopter). 

&gt;crypto services, but you can't withdraw them, you're basically asking them to invest but you can't touch your money... it's essentially being held by them as a promise you've bought crypto-currency. 

This is a legal restriction. It is nigh on impossible to let retail users transfer crypto in and out of UK based platforms without falling on the wrong side of regulation. Most UK banks won't even let you send sterling to foreign platforms associated with crypto.

Revolut offer the ability to invest in crypto within the UK regulatory framework. It's a service very few other providers offer - I'd argue its better to have it as it stands than to have no option but using foreign services which often involve routing money via secondary accounts.

&gt;I honestly, strongly avoid using this shoddy company at all costs. To me, it looks like they're scamming people by refusing access

I've had accounts frozen by high Street banks. They act in exactly the same way - they won't tell you why and don't give any indication of when you'll regain access. You've happened to have a bad experience with Revolut so you're applying bias. The same problem occurs with searching forums - a massively higher percentage of users voice frustrations in these places than praise.

&gt;Imagine being in a foreign country, relying on this card but unable to use it for 5 days because their support is too busy tweeting gifs.

You should always have a second payment method - whether abroad or in the UK. Ideally cards with two separate institutions using two separate card issuers (visa/mastercard/amex).

&gt;said the £2.00 purchase rounded up another £1.00 to be saved somehow (so this essentially is bugged, but is released publicly - yet another thing that's shoddy and untested

Bugs happen - especially with new features. Moving £1 more to your savings account than you expected certainly beats TSB's recent fun. I'd argue them investigating and fixing it is implicit - Revolut don't have a history of ignoring bugs.

&gt;I've lost money due to their stupidity - don't fall for the same tricks

Have you? It sounds like they are still handling it. If you genuinely think they have stolen your money and do not aim to return it then reverse the transaction with your bank and place a complaint with the ombudsman /FCA. "

And don't even get me started on the graduation photos. In my first uni they were free as well, but for my second degree they wanted around 200 GBP for two photo motives  and a total of maybe 6 or 8 prints WITHOUT a frame. Frame started from 50 GBP. After paying tens of thousands of pounds for years of education, why do universities like to give students a final ""fuck you""? It sours that once in a lifetime special occasion to no end. At least mobile phones can take adequate photos nowadays, which are also much more personal. No need to throw money out of the window for graduation photos."
"When a group can't agree on an outcome, voting is a way where we can agree on a process that aggregates preferences to an outcome. Unfortunately, if we can't agree on the process then voting on how we vote still has the same problem.

As for insincere range voting, consider a voter that feels A:9,B:7,C:3. The first step is to maximize your most preferred and minimize your least: (10,7,0). The second step is based on polling information, if A is polling better than C, you'd vote (10,0,0). If A is polling worse than C, then you'd vote (10,10,0).

Range voting devolves into approval voting for the strategic voter and those with accurate polling information have notably more powerful ballots than those of the tactically naive. I'd argue that preferences can't easily and sincerely be assigned numerical values when outcomes are based on them. "

"Quite right. The government already said that they would retain the GDPR over a year ago IIRC, so I used that as just an example of a regulation changing because it is one most people are familiar with.

But the problem \(I believe\) is that EU compliance will no longer automatically apply to the UK after the exit date. Companies dealing with UK firms will have to treat them as a third country and take the necessary steps about data leaving the EU even if the laws remain unchanged. The UK really need mutual recognition \- but that would mean having to keep our laws in sync with the EU \- which means passing whatever laws Brussels deems necessary in future. And \(I think\) remaining subject to the ECJ for ultimate decisions. Perhaps something can be worked out as part of the deal, but it would absolutely involve the UK taking orders from the EU on data protection.

Plus, the EU have said that mutual recognition is not on the table at all anyway. Maybe they will make an exception for data protection, as long as the UK accepts all future EU changes. Guess we'll have to wait and see.

&gt; The Mount Merapi volcano on densely populated Java island is one of the most active in Indonesia and a series of eruptions in 2010 killed more than 350 people.

&gt; A disaster mitigation agency told residents living within a 5 km radius of the mountain to move to shelters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a statement.

&gt; The disaster agency described Merapi&amp;#039;s latest eruption as phreatic, which means magma heats up ground water and vapor is released under pressure.

Is it ok to use the aha and bha on the same night, or should I do them on different nights? 

I'm suppose to use the aha/bha toner before using the bha or aha to prep the skin right? Also, how do people use this? For my bha i just put some on the back of my hand, rub it with a finger, then rub it on my face. Is it ok to do this for the aha liquid as well as the aha/bha toner?

Since the cosrx 95 is an essence, would I use it after the bha or aha and before toners/moisturizers? "

Apply those criteria to fiat, will you?

"Yeah, it's a similar sort of political compromise, but much smaller. Iirc, the catapult question went round and round before settling on a sort of non-answer. The ships' not being nuclear meant that the usual steam system was off the table, a brand new system was a difficult sell, politically, and designing in the capability to upgrade to an electric system in the future was too *easy*, politically, to cut. That's how I remember it, at least.

I mean, the Typhoon's unlikely to fly from a carrier, no matter what; the F35 and its B variant was already locked in; anything else someone might want to fly from the carriers in the future (Taranis/MQ25/MUX) ... well, that's the future's problem, right?"

It's real simple. Socialized medicine gets rid of the middle-man insurance companies and their billions of dollars of waste, our taxes slightly increase while we get rid of gigantic deductible, and no one has to worry that their cancer treatment won't be covered because they had a mole once. The only change is how treatment is paid for, and we get the added benefit of actually being able to collectively bargain pharmaceutical costs so those companies can't charge $11,000 for an so epi-pen that costs $100 everywhere else. AND small businesses don't get crushed by increased cost of insuring employees. There are literally no losers except insurance company executives, hospital administrators, and right-wing pundits."

Put another way, if you don't own Steem but want to fully participate in Steemit, you have to buy Steem first.

"&gt;how is the bonus on the lifetime ISA worked out?

It's the same 25% bonus as the Help To Buy ISA, except the bonus is given to you at a different time.

With the H2B, the 25% on your total contributions is given to you when you close the account as part of the process of purchasing your property. You currently have £4800 in the account, when you close the account (using the proper procedure) you'll get £4800 + £1200 = £6000 total.

With the LISA, there isn't such a long delay on you getting your hands on the bonus. The 25% on your contributions is given to you in the month following your contribution to the LISA. So say you put £4000 into the account today, at some point in June or July (not 100% sure on the timeline, this is the first month this process has been used) you will get the £1000 bonus paid into the account taking the total to £5000.

No, seriously, that's about the only way you'll get any decent discounts for direct shipments. You can get slight discounts through eBay and some shipping services like Stamps.com

"It depends on their masses, spin, and how closely they orbit.  This can be shown by three different cases:

Orbits slow due to something like friction.  Tides are an example of our moon pulling against the full width of Earth.  In our case these rotations slowed while the moon slipped further away.   

Similarly the friction causes tidal heating in Jupiter and Saturn moons.  Yet closer objects circle faster down the gravity well of our gas giants, opposite to the Earth-moon-system. 

Black holes are glorious.  It's as if masses slow by being pulled against themselves, plummet inwards, then circle the 'drain'.

I don't know the math ~~for twin gas giants~~, but if they're linked after a long while they're probably inching toward one another. "

"&gt; 32 Mb is not going to cut it. Neither is 1 Gb or 10 Gb. 

[""VisaNet handles an average of 150 million transactions every day and is capable of handling more than 24,000 transactions per second.""](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html)

150 Million per day is roughly 1,737 TPS. 7 TPS per MB means ~248 MB per block.

Peak of 24,000 that they're capable of is probably for 1 minute during cyber Monday or something.

That is possible with 3.5 GB blocks, but there would probably be less than a handful each year.

With P2P, P2B, B2B, and B2P, 290 billion to 580 billion additional transactions, with 10-20% cash replacement. Estimated 3,430 Billion yearly transactions.

290 Billion per year would require ~1.3 GB blocks. ~9,190 TPS

580 Billion per year would require ~2.7 GB blocks. ~18,379 TPS

~3.4 Trillion per year would require ~15.5 GB blocks. ~108,690 TPS

There are no trade-offs necessary, with adoption doubling every year, the network and hardware can handle it up-to and way past every single payment in the whole world being done on-chain.

&gt;The reason why BCH is performing abysmally is because the project itself is flawed. It'll never take over BTC because it's a contentious fork that ignores consensus and focuses on the least important aspect (merchant adoption/day-to-day TX). 

This is all highly subjective. People will choose what works, despite the history. People from all over the world still want to come to the United States, despite it's history.

&gt;Decentralization, immutability, censorship resistance, fungibility, etc. Those are the crucial aspects, not how cheaply you can buy a coffee.

These are all top priorities of the BCH devs, and community. Higher transaction volume makes it even more censorship resistant and fungible."

"Second line of the abstract there man. ;)

""RES units, notably inverter-connected wind turbines and photovoltaics (PV) that as such *do not provide rotational inertia*, are effectively displacing conventional generators and their rotating machinery.""

Big spinning generators give system inertia because they're basically a big hunk of metal/magnet spinning in time with the system inside a magnetic field (bit simplified but it'll do). As the system frequency drops or rises, they have to be pulled along decelerating/accelerating along with it.

Variable speed generators like wind turbines are decoupled from the system by design. They spin at whatever rate they're pushed at, then use clever power electronics at the end to fix it up to match the system frequency. It means you can't get inertia out of them. You can do some smart trickery with the power electronics to get a synthetic inertia response, but it's a little slower and not nearly as foolproof (badly managed, they can end up over-responding, triggering protection and isolating chunks of the grid or even causing a full black out).

(As far as not being an expert goes, no sweat - I'm mostly just happy when someone links a decent research paper and not some crazy half assed blog. ;) )"

"Mr Gavin Mcinnes, on the Holocaust:

&gt;“Like at one point, the [Yad Vashem] tour guide goes, ‘You know, and there are people who think that this didn’t happen.’ And I felt myself defending the super-far-right Nazis, just because I was sick of so much brainwashing. And I felt like going, ‘Well, they never said it didn’t happen. What they’re saying is that it was much less than six million and that they starved to death and they weren’t gassed.'”

Mr Gavin Mcinnes on the Holodomor (the starvation of 10 million Ukrainians in the early 1930s):

&gt;“That was by Jews. That was by Marxist, Stalinist, left-wing, commie, socialist Jews.”

Mr Gavin Mcinnes on the Treaty of Versailles (or according to him ""the deal that Germany got after the war that sucked""):

&gt;“Wasn’t the Treaty of Versailles, wasn’t that disproportionately influenced by Jewish intellectuals?”

Not really surprising that his comments drew praise from Mr David Duke of the KKK and Richard Spencer.

Let's keep going with Ms Lauren ""[The Great Replacement](https://youtube.com/watch?v=OTDmsmN43NA)"" Southern:

Lauren Southern is a great believer in the idea that white people are going to be replaced within a generation by Muslims/black people. This is probably why she's a supporter of Defend Europe, an identitarian group, and supported them at one of their marches in France. If you've never heard of identitarianism before ... they're white nationalists who believe that white genocide is a thing that's happening in Europe.

And Mr Milo Yiannopolous? Well ... I'm just going to leave [this video of him singing karaoke at a white supremacist meetup while they all do the Nazi salute at him](https://youtube.com/watch?v=XLNLPIRS62g&amp;ebc=ANyPxKoj5jL2YZQireWDd_BTm7MbGmo2NPD87cFhPCtPRrgme7BCsqD2rDtwIimI52X69XBa7c1d9hOXxr6CB1aAfIloXuxTYw) here.

And that's not even going anywhere near all the awful stuff that people like Tommy Robinson say, even if they can't be called white nationalists or the like.

"First you sidestep that you provided  two strawmen arguments. Then you make a declaratice statement ""No 'commission of inquiry' is going to 'set policy' either."""" I'm sorry, but is without substantiation as it has not occurred yet. I understand you may have a political view, but that hasn't determined reality. Such a commission could fall flat, achieve wonderful results and more. 

Then this: ""Ford, as usual, is excessively vague in the rationale behind his decisions and promises."", then go on that he is specifically is contradicting my view. Which is It? Of course, again, more strawmen for you to knock down as his statements are similar to other politicians with their philosophical approaches to issues such as ""diversity is our strength"".  There is an overall approach that he has as a guiding principle. I understand that some people locked into a political view may not be able understand that.  But to dismiss it as vague or contradictory is not genuine to political discourse.

&gt; If you want to see how peaceful a country can be without a military, go look up any pacifist nations in history, they all got their asses conquered. 

And show me a country that builds up a might army that doesn't go to war all over the globe. Take Germany and Japan, I think both countries constitutions forbid foreign military action. You can still have a defense force against foreign aggression. I have no real objection to that. 

But Romans, the Royal Navy, everybody that uses that quote are incredible warmongers. So I don't understand why you defend it. 

As for one pacifist nation not being conquered

&gt; On December 1, 1948, **President José Figueres Ferrer of Costa Rica abolished the Costa Rican military.** In 1949, the abolition of the military was introduced in Article 12 of the Costa Rican constitution. The budget previously dedicated to the military is now dedicated to providing health care services and education

If I am not mistaken that gives pacifists nations a 100% *non-conquered* rate. Which is a even better % than heavily militaristic ones.

"Much of New York's teachers are also employed in or around NYC, where costs of living are insanely high. I'd be willing to bet that if you adjusted for that, the difference would be at least as great as the difference between current pension costs, and what you might consider more ideal. I'm sure New York pensions are still more expensive than they should be even adjusting for cost of living, but the reality is that a lot of the costs relative to other places are just because it's expensive to employ teachers somewhere it's expensive to live.

The loss of global wealth resulting from not exterminating FFs directly leads to a banking crisis, and then sovereign debt crisis and other financial asset depreciation which are completely dependent on the banking system.

The world investing in needed infrastructure makes the world richer similarly to investment in the road network.  In the case of renewables/ammonia/hydrogen, it can all be done by the private sector with a market environment that both incentivizes consumers to switch to the world saving infrastructure, and with the dividend, gives them the means/cash to do so."
"I have *been* a knowledgeable Christian before. Grew up in the church and Young Life, been part of churches of several different Protestant denominations, did Intervarsity in college, studied theology and apologetics Somme on my own as a hobby. I cared more about having a rational basis for what I believed more than any Christian I have ever met. I lost my faith when I found that the evidence wasn't there too support it. Looking back, I cringe at some of the apologetics arguments I believed and used. All of the apologetic arguments I've ever come across were some combination of ignorant, fallacious, or naive. I've never come across a Christian who was truly rational regarding their beliefs - based on the glaring lack of evidence, I think it's basically a contradiction. Atheists can be irrational as well, of course, but it's not necessitated by their atheism. 

I have met nice Christians, of course. But they reject the notion that their religion, even done properly (according to whatever denomination they're in), causes active harm to people. They also cherry pick their morals from various places in the Bible according to their own prejudices (or their family's, or denomination' s...) and worship  a vengeful, egotistical, genocidal warlord of a God (have you read the OT? It's brutal). Most will then turn around and say that Christians have the best system of morality, and the only objective one. Even the otherwise rational Christians believe some really ridiculous and bigoted claims about  others, and especially about atheists and LGBTQ people. As far as I've been able to tell with even my own family, Christianity deadens both their morals and their rational doubts. Even the pleasant and intelligent Christian laypersons aren't off the hook on these counts, in my experience. I know I wasn't, either. "

Which is why I like the measuring definition of 'deranged', as in 'out of range for this input'.

"I disagree with your article about Soylent!

Specifically: arguing over a Vitamin X that we have no knowledge of. there could be, but there could not be, and taking the lesser route epistemologically of doubting the proposition of Vitamin X until further evidence suggests its existence is the preferred option from a pure logical standpoint.

what I find odd is that you eschew the modern understanding of dietary needs in favor of... what? what else so you use as guidance other than the prevailing consensus amongst expert literature? do you eat food at random? do you consult the ancients with diviners bones? no, I mean of course not that's absurd. this is akin to ignoring the expert consensus on any other scientific field: like arguing global warming isn't caused by people because it could actually be caused by Imaginary X that we simply haven't observed yet.

that argument would probably annoy the absolute shit out of you, but it's pretty much the same thing you're saying about nutrition (in certain parts of your article)

although I do agree with you that Soylent is wack and it is more a pop fad than alternatives (like [Schmilk](http://superbodyfuel.com) which actually goes about balancing your macronutrients and is my preferred product.

its nutritional information is freely available on the website so you can take a look yourself.

"&gt; This is the biggest failing of democracy that the votes  of a willfully ignorant idiot count the same of those who try to vote based on more than free food at barbecues and the results of that can be seen in the US.

And your view that this is a weakness can lead to dictatorships. Once we stop agreeing that all citizens have a right to influence the political direction of the nation due to not having the right ideas, we start down a path that is too likely to lead to only a small group of people, or an individual, being seen as having the right stuff to decide for society.

No one person, or small group of people can know enough to answer every question, so the person you feel is an idiot on one topic, may be an expert on another. Cutting them out of political decision making based on that one idiotic view, risks losing their voice on the matter they're an expert on, which seems silly and wasteful.

The greatest concern though, is who decides what makes one an idiot or not? So many political matters are judgement calls based on ideologies, and there are many different views of what goal is the right one, and then many more on how to achieve those goals. Reducing those view points is a danger."

It is however possible for one body to be the dominant attractor of other bodies. Every body has a [hill sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere) where their gravity dominates other bodies' gravity. 

The [Oort cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud) - the furthest group of bodies of our solar system - extends about 100,000 AU, and Voyager 1 is now about 141 AU. So I think vger is still in the Sun's hill sphere."

&gt; A subsequent CNN KFile review of her Twitter account &amp;quot;RepublicanChick&amp;quot; found that Barreto also repeatedly used the hashtag #BanIslam and shared conspiracy theories about the death of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich.

&gt; An HHS official told CNN&amp;#039;s KFile Tuesday night that Barreto would not be returning to the public affairs department and would instead serve in a different role working on unspecified projects.

&gt; The official said no complaints about Barreto&amp;#039;s conduct had been filed through department channels during her time at HHS. Barreto apologized for her comments in a statement provided by HHS. &amp;quot;Comments I made as I private citizen before I was hired at HHS were brought to light by concerned members of the press,&amp;quot; Barreto said.

"I have a similar issue - frequent loose stools, often I feel it's food related, but then I eat something unhealthy and it's solid - did a 24h fast and it helped tremendously, but only for a week or so...  

I'd be very interested to see what entails the 3+5+3?  


I read you wrote that you fasted for 5 days? Does that mean not eating for 5 days? How is that even possible?

For example, the gun club up at the cottage is really just an old sand pit with a locked gate where all the members have a key. We obviously don't have the budget to clean up all the lead in that backstop, and we could ban the use of it if environmental restrictions were put in place. But who says that Jack up the road doesn't go in there one weekend and run through a bucket of cheap Chinese ammo? Now our range gets shut down, and I suffer because of one idiot who doesn't want to play by the rules. I'd much rather just do away with the stuff completely, let the market adapt wholely and never have to worry about lead again. I've lost access to several indoor ranges over the years because of the issue of lead contamination and no budget to clean it up. Honestly it just makes more sense to remove the source of the problem all together."

"It's not that they're paid to lie or confuse you. They're minimum wage peons hired off the street with no qualifications other than they're able to work on a semi-regular basis. I've been in their shoes and most of them don't care enough and somehow think that getting you off the phone quicker is better for them because it lowers their handle time, when in reality it just causes them more problems in the future when you inevitably have to call back and deal with the same issue that's likely been made worse because the previous rep didn't bother learning anything beyond the basics.

For billing reps, the plans and prices change constantly so they're supposed to keep up on all the new changes but again they just don't care enough. Instead they'll quote you something they remember and once they realize it's not actually available anymore, they'll change it to something else, note the account that they quoted you the correct price, and then end the call. I've literally have reps do this on more than one occasion, so when I call back I get ""well the notes say they told you this price so there's nothing we can do"". Because this has happened so often, I record my own calls and insist they go back and listen to the call themselves to verify that that is not what I was told and I don't stop until I get what I was told or at least get credit to make up for it.

For tech support, they're again trained on the basics but no one bothers to learn anything other than ""did you turn it off and back on again?"". I've actually had reps who had no idea that I could access the modem page and see the signal levels myself. They flat out refused to believe it was their modem and not my router."

"&gt;Good! Have they also banned elective hormone therapy and sex change operations for minors?

Hormone therapy and sex change operations are only performed on intersex minors (as in, they congenitally possess partially formed genitalia from both genders), generally out of necessity because you don't function too well down there in any capacity with deformed half-and-half goods.

The only thing that is done to transgender minors, after recommendation from a doctor, is hormone blockers, which do not have any significant known side effects nor long-term damage, until they are of age to legally make their own decisions. They overwhelmingly (greater than 90% if I remember correctly) stick with it, and the research done overwhelmingly shows positive effects on their mental health and large reductions in suicide rate.

I don't understand how people like you work; you've clearly done no research, you do not understand the most basic facts about what you're discussing, and yet you feel fully comfortable voicing your moronic opinions on this issue and claiming things with absolutely no factual basis, that you just assume are true. Are you like this with everything? Do you just form deep-set opinions instantly based on your instinctive emotional response, then never introspect or fact-check to see if you actually have good reasons for what you believe?

And before you spout off your final idiotic point that you all seem to have, because clearly fuckwits like you congregate somewhere I don't care to go, that one study that you think points to transgender suicide rates not being helped by transition (in a sea of ones demonstrating the opposite) does not in fact demonstrate that; the author of the paper herself has gone on record multiple times to say directly that transphobic morons are deliberately misinterpreting her work, because it does not demonstrate what they claim it does."

"They offer Regular Mutual funds only which has greater expense ratio, so you pay more as commission to them, in direct funds expense ratio is low which is only utilised by AMC."
Second that
"""Leaking"" is the key word here. Comey passed non-classified private information to a friend, who passed it on to a reporter. It's tempting to call that a ""leak"", since it was done secretively and involved private information, but some (including Comey) say that a leak must involve classified information, and so therefore he didn't ""leak"" anything. 

I think about it like this: let's say Jeff Sessions has dinner with Trump, and notices that not only is Trump having cereal for dinner, but he's eating it with a fork. He thinks that's weird, and he's got a bone to pick with Trump, so he tells a friend to tell a reporter about it, and it's in all the headlines the next day. That isn't really a leak, in my opinion. It's impolite and grounds for being fired, perhaps, but it doesn't break any law. 

Anyway, if you believe that ""leaking"" doesn't have to involve classified information, then Comey lied when he said he never leaked anything. But if you agree with his definition, then I don't think he's said anything else that's a demonstrable lie. I'm not sure if there's a legal definition for ""leaking"", but I think this is all a purely semantic argument, so it's pretty weak as far as arguments against Comey's character go. If you want to prove that someone's a liar, you have to do better than ""he said something that he believes is true but I don't."""

"No, by preventing government agencies from doing research on firearms(Turns out that owning guns actually makes you more likely to get shot, statistically speaking. NRA didn't like that so they had some lobbying done to prevent that from happening again), by lobbying to prevent modernization of gun sales tracking on a federal level(Which is an issue that should not worry legitimate owners, as they shouldn't be in danger of having their gun serials traced. As a side note, it's also what prevents you from buying a actual machine gun besides one of a few antiques.), and by generally getting people needlessly riled up into believing that there's actually a war on gun ownership, which is an amazingly retarded statement at best.


If the NRA just defended the 2nd amendment, even the horribly redefined and twisted version of it that exists today, it'd be much more tolerable.


Actually, I'd like to talk about that first one more, because it has some hilarious quotes.

&gt;""It wasn't necessary that all research stop,"" Dickey said. ""It just couldn't be the collection of data so that they can advocate gun control. That's all we were talking about. But for some reason, it just stopped altogether.""

""We aren't against research, just research that doesn't happen to align with our preconceived notions of what should happen."" is a reoccurring theme on the topic. The name, if it's unfamiliar, belongs to the guy who fucked the CDC for the NRA. A moron from the state of Arkansas who just can't figure out why the CDC doesn't do research on guns after he made it so they couldn't pay for any research that might make guns look bad. He just can't figure it out.

As for the last one, any talk about banning guns gets huge amounts of pushback, which basically locks up congress any time that there is any sort of shooting or public incident. Even the scariest looking firearm will get defended by an large number of people who are either fans or just like guns in general.

I personally, am not against guns, and am totally against ""scary weapon bans,"" but I also am not a fan of an organization that acts as a lodestone to any research on a topic because it might impact their donators bottom lines. I'm not a fan of any organization that feels the need to cripple law enforcement because it might impact a few hundred people into not wanting a gun, despite registration of all cars not impeding car sales particularly significantly."

"It’s not a debate. I’m just pointing out you don’t fundamentally understand what an option is.

Here you go

You said 

&gt; Most people there are playing options so the underlying price of the stock isn't really a huge deal.

An option is 

&gt;The buyer of the call option has the right, but not the obligation, to buy an agreed quantity of a particular commodity or financial instrument (the underlying) from the seller of the option at a certain time (the expiration date) for a certain price (the strike price). The seller (or ""writer"") is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument to the buyer if the buyer so decides. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right. The term ""call"" comes from the fact that the owner has the right to ""call the stock away"" from the seller.

For dummies like you, I’ll translate : an option is a legal right to buy the underlying stock.

So when you say “the stock price doesn’t matter much”- that is simply incorrect.

When you pay $1 to purchase the right to buy a stock at $10 that is currently worth $9, your option has an intrinsic value based on various inputs (generally a model like the B/S model has various inputs to come up with the option value).

When the stock change to be $12, a 30%ish increase, your option becomes “in the money” because you hold an instrument that allows you to legally buy the $12 stock for $10.

So when you say, as you said above, 

&gt; Most people there are playing options so the underlying price of the stock isn't really a huge deal.

The stock price is literally what determines if your option has any value to it.

"It's strange, Trump was known as a great negotiator before he became a Republican. He was also known as a man who would invent a persona for himself to suit his needs, which is why people get a different impression from private Trump and public Trump. He may not be eloquent, but he has always been manipulative. 

He played the madman against North Korea and it worked. Trump has a much stronger hand in international politics than Obama, because Trump isn't seen as a pushover, instead he's seen as unpredictable and stubborn, which are perfect traits as a negotiator.

**Now** Trump is openly *admitting* the NDA is between himself and Stormy, so basically he is openly *admitting* he's David Dennison (this has been known for like, ever) AND he is openly *admitting* that at some point he felt he needed to pay somebody a bunch of money and sign a legal document under a fake name to stay quiet about a sexual affair (which according to him didn't happen)... but since he *never signed the NDA*, the whole thing is void, and Stormy can spill the beans--right?"

&gt;I'm saying systematic racism does not currently exist.

That depends on who you ask. Schools in the south are still [effectively segregated.](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/05/why-southern-schools-are-becoming-more-segregated/528540/) Black folks were [just now allowed to wear their natural hair in the Army.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/coming-soon-to-the-us-army-turbans-beards-hijabs-and-cornrows/512204/) Black folks are still arrested and sentenced at higher rates than their white counterparts for weed, [despite equal rates of weed use.](https://www.aclu.org/report/report-war-marijuana-black-and-white?redirect=criminal-law-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white) Black folks are continually [disenfranchised at the polls.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/north-carolina-voting-rights-law/493649/) Hell, Black folks are half as likely to receive pain medication in the ER because they're still believed to [have a higher tolerance for pain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/) None of this is happening to white people. I don't see how that can be described as anything *but* systemic. These issues are mostly holdovers from actual racist policies and beliefs of the past. They just get called out more today. 

Like I mentioned above, we should invest in the programs designed to help folks better themselves. Community outreach, youth programs like Big Brothers Big Sisters or the Boys and Girls Club, sometimes even charter schools. Welfare and financial literacy courses. Scholarships for black kids, and tempered affirmative action (which, incidentally, [helps white women the most](https://www.brit.co/newsflash-affirmative-action-most-benefits-white-women/).)

Let's say you're right, and systemic racism doesn't exist anymore. When did it end, exactly? Why do all these issues still exist, if the systemic racism has gone away?

So, car owners pay a nominal fee to the city, if any, and a non-insignificant number of them dont even pay that by registering out of state.

To your point concerning the bus route only impacting those who want to use transit. This would be more impactful if there were calls to eliminate the bus route entirely, that is not the case.

Talking about fiat currencies dropping in value is not “conspiracy”... every single year currencies rise and fall. It has happened to every government-issued fiat, including the USD, and it will happen again eventually."

As far at the ""ok to be white"" thing goes, I think you might be falling for an extremely simple rhetorical trap.  That phrase was chosen specifically because it's an excellent dogwhistle; while on the surface it is 100% true, nobody who uses it as a slogan does so without provocative intent.  Of course it's ok to be white, the only people who don't think so are raving lunatics that sensible people  rightfully ignore.  Just because the media you choose to consume makes a spectacle of it doesn't make it an epidemic, and the idea poses less existential threat to you than being struck by lightning."

"There's isn't one employee of a bank or brokerage house that isn't in it to sell you shit. It's their job and they literally quotas to meet.

So what does that leave?

Financial planners that don't work for the banks or brokerages.......these people set up their own shops usually because the banks and brokerages did not want want them. They also have shit they want to sell to get commissions and that's how they make a living.

All of the above are basically asset allocation monkeys (% bonds/stocks/cash) and this is what they bring to the table. To someone who know dick fuck all about investing, this is a big deal. Their understanding of structure is average at best, the best tricks they actually learned from their clients over the years.

The only two people for the job are:

1) High powered CPA.....they will charge you probably 4++ thousand a year to do your taxes and probably won't bring you 4++ thousand worth of savings. Most of them are just salesmen while they have an army of tax preparers doing what basically amounts to data entry.

99% of them are pretty useless but if you find a great one, that's like gold and you hold on to them for dear life.

What they are really good for is to keep you from paying penalties and staying out of jail if there are a lot of things on your tax return that are complicated.

But if you start your own taxes very early you will probably get all the answers on your own..

2) Tax lawyer. These are are the guys who know the most. They know the real tricks as to how and why to set up structures which is where the only real savings come from.

It's impossible to say how much they can do for you because it depends on total revenue, how many sources, what the sources are.

If you have less than 7 digits in assets and make less than combined household income of 150 k a year then you should probably go it alone. If you do have more than 7 digits then it's good to have a tax lawyer because if the CRA comes sniffing around you have to lawyer up right away.......even if you are 100% honest. CRA does not fuck around and neither should you.

"""I think the issue is that people have a vision of what Bitcoin is, that doesn't align with the reality of a proof-of-work system with a computation bound hash. The block size is basically orthogonal to the proof-of-work, and the proof-of-work is distributed in the sense that anyone can do it. There is nothing stopping any entity from doing the proof-of-work if they have the resources and capabilities. So this idea that there will be one company that is the only one doing Bitcoin doesn't really make sense if it's cost competitive for other companies to be involved. 

""End users can still validate transactions via SPV, which is completely valid and provable without storing the entire block chain. Consensus relay nodes can do the same thing, although they will start dropping off the network when the bandwidth costs become prohibitive. So in a small block system we have an extremely limited amount of space for transactions, which means the cost will eventually be excessively high and result in settlement between big players. That's the choke point that allows for KYC and AML. You can submit a transaction to the network, but you can't afford to because there isn't enough bandwidth to service your request so you are forced into regulated channels, onto exchanges, or through third party choke points that can be audited.

""People who want small blocks for Bitcoin really need to be thinking about using an altcoin, it was never in the plans to have an extremely low bandwidth pipe to keep things decentralized when the proof-of-work is by default a centralizing force.” *

"A non invasive blood glucose monitor was invented more than a decade ago by a doctor in Chicago. He got a lot of press at the time. He even appeared with his invention on the Oprah Winfrey show. In fact, he was my dads doctor for a time. His invention used an optical method for measuring blood glucose at the surface of the skin. Put your finger on the sensor and you got a nearly instant reading without the need to draw blood. He sold the patent to a drug company that promised to bring the tech to market. They shelved it. To be honest, I don't know why. It may not have been viable as a consumer product, but it could also be that it was more profitable to sell test strips forever than one device one time.

"Yeah, BTC and LN proponents are predating on ignorance regarding the importance of the economic incentives that keeps centralization in check, and maintains a health equilibrium between participants.

Instead they want to you believe them, and not ask too much questions. Just appeal to authority.

Someone told me recently: 

&gt; Nothing prevents a routing system that doesn’t require full knowledge of connectivity graph. It just won’t be as precise. Traveling salesman problem is NP hard but nothing stops DHL or USPS from solving it thousands of times every day. 

But that's delusional. A more appropriate example woudl be like if DHL or USPS had to deliver the packages not to the destination address directly, but they'd have to find interemediary addresses that must be able to deliver to an indeterminate number of other intermediary address... Those addresses must have a communication channel open with enough funds to be a valid graph node. And then after delivering the package, those addresses may not be valid any more for subsequent deliveries. The global routing map changes every second and somehow everybody must be on the same page to keep it decentralized. This is nuts.

And:

&gt; You only see LN working as centralized hub-spoke model because it’s what shills in this community want you to see it that way.

&gt;  Also you claiming routing problem can’t be solved is the same fud. It’s a graph problem, we know algorithms to solve graph problems. Solution doesn’t have to be perfect for routing to work.

But they never explain the way they are going to do that. Because they can't. It turns out they managed to solve one of the hardest problems in CS and they are keeping it to themselves because reasons. Don't trust your own understanding, just believe them. Yes, it makes total sense."

"It's possible to respond the statements by May or Singh by talking about Hamas' role in the protests, or the history of attacks using civilians as cover. I don't think either one's statement is unfair in the slightest, but that's a valid counter-argument in terms of defending Israel's actions. I would still say it's not a justification but at least it's context that illustrates the complexity of the situation. 

However, immediately responding with THIS kind of language:

&gt;B’nai Brith Canada CEO Michael Mostyn **accused May of promoting a “blood libel” against Israel.**

...Is UTTERLY unacceptable. Talking about ""Blood Libel"" against jewish people is a massively serious accusation. That is accusing May of [repeating the antisemitic conspiracy of Jewish people literally performing ritual sacrifice of babies as part of religious practices.](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/glossary-terms/blood-libel) 

Absolutely nothing either May or Singh said can remotely be compared to that kind of accusation, and trying to pretend it was is disgusting. 

Not to mention the rank sexism in the language used by CIJA: 

&gt;Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) spokesperson Martin Sampson said May’s statement was **“shrill and divorced from reality”** and “not a serious policy position.”

"TL;DR for the article: America is Already Great

That was very unconvincing. There are disadvantages that women have, that the article glossed over and dismissed for no reason. Ten years ago, I spent countless hours reading stories from Hollaback NYC and [related sites](http://whenwomenrefuse.tumblr.com/) - that's one that has recent updates. I learned about the spectrum of abuse that women and minorities endure from strangers (yes, and men too, but not nearly as often). It ranges from a ""hey, beautiful"" from a complete stranger, to [murder](https://www.insideedition.com/headlines/9233-rejection-revenge-hit-and-run-shatters-young-womans-bones). When someone is walking on the street and doesn't feel like talking (which is her right), and she dismisses the ""hey, beautiful"", which instantly ramps up to ""stuck up bitch"" and worse - that's when she realizes that the ""hey, beautiful""s were never intended to be innocuous or well meaning. This is a problem that can be fixed with education, without needing to involve politicians, and when women can walk streets without being harrassed, they're free to help you with your - everyone's - problems.

So this Hillary-esque ""what's the problem?"" article doesn't notice that women still don't have equal opportunities. There still hasn't been a woman professional umpire in major league baseball, and some women have wanted to be. There's no good reason why women can't do that job. Bernice Gera was the first woman professional umpire, and she worked her first major game and the other umpires wouldn't cooperate with her. Pam Postema was passed over for a promotion twice and let go from her job.

I don't know what modern feminism is about, but this article is vaguely written, weak, and doesn't have a convincing argument against it. I only know about my own feminism, and there is still a need for it. There's still a need to point out that women and men need to be treated equally, and that everyone needs to be treated with respect.

Strength, courage, work ethic, pride, are all traditional masculine values. So are concepts such as looking after one's self and one's interests, including one's mind and body. So is altruism: patriarchal organizations like traditionalist churches are extremely charitable. 

The chivalric code dates back about a millenium, and takes its roots from philosophies dating back to Socrates and others of his time, as well as Christian traditions. 

The modern labour movement which gave rise to greater welfare programs and a social safety net was a boy's club."

"I'm reminded of a story about Benjamin Franklin. When hot air balloons were first being invented, and they didn't work very well, but Franklin invested a lot of money to fund scientist's research for how to make them work better. This was the first recorded example of human flight, but Franklin was asked why he wasted his money on it, he was asked: 

""What use is this invention?""

He responded ""what use is a newborn baby?""

Franklin's point was that inventions and scientific research often do not have clear reasons for them at the time, it is after we acquire knowledge that we realize what it's used for. I think the same concept applies to to intergalactic travel."

"Absolutely. It is the fundamental flaw of Marxism, and it does lead to dictatorships, as has been seen before. And you’re right, Corbyn isn’t a proper Marxist; he probably agrees with most of Marx’s critique of capitalism (as should any politician, in fact I’d be worried if there was a politician anywhere who hasn’t read Marx) but to suggest he wants to recreate the Soviet Union is just scare tactics and propaganda.

After midterms, there is nothing else they will be able to accomplish and they know that Trump is a liability. If he is impeached many supporting him will likely distance themselves, and those that have been quietly unhappy will put country ahead of party.

Right now the GOP is imploding. All the chaos in government right now is republicans investigating and indicting other republicans. Truly I'm surprised no one on the left is capitalizing on this fact. The GOP is in disarray and after midterms that party will look very different I believe."

No belief is necessary. No principled or un-pragmatic take needs to be religiously adhered-to to make a case against NN. Just on utilitarian grounds alone, many (possibly most) economists do not believe that the NN regulations are an effective response to the percieved or potential problems stemming from the lack of present competition in the industry.  You may want to actually explore and understand their arguments and data.

It's also worth noting that the uncompetitive state of the industry is largely a product of prior government policies...as usual, the masses never consider that (despite us trying to explain this fact) and so don't think to explore what might be repealed in order to create better incentives in the space...they just buy in to the single-faceted mindset that a problem exists, thus we must regulate a solution, and buy in to the popular rhetoric that there can't possibly be an argument against net neutrality.

"Nothing is wrong with your skin, I promise! It just takes continued experimenting to find the right combo of products that work for you. I've tried countless primers in the last few years, with little success, and finally found Touch in Sol No Poreblem and for my skin, it's perfect! I also use Laura Mercier Setting Powder and UD All Nighter. As I've been testing sunscreens, I've noticed some break apart my foundation, while others don't affect my makeup, so there's another piece to the puzzle. Are you letting your moisturizer and sunscreen steps sink in before adding primer/makeup? I found that can make a difference in how my makeup wears throughout the day. Also, you could try experimenting with moving any skincare products you suspect of impacting your makeup negatively to your evening routine (not sunscreen, of course). Hang in there!"

"To soothe the experience of having to watch it, I'd recommend the ""God Awful Movies"" podcast take-down of it. It's hilarious. The movie is sincerely terrible. 

But if someone recommended that to me, my guess would be that they probably just want to feel like my mind is open to opposing evidence. Most of my elderly religious relatives think my whole being an atheist thing is a phase. They also think my being gay is a phase. I'd give it about equal odds as to either of those hypotheses being true. 

Honestly, I don't think making her read an atheist book will help much. I think your best outcome may simply be to humor her and tell her you're open to future evidence changing your mind, even if Strobel's movie did not (and I assure you, it won't).

"It wouldn't be *that* bad because launching from the Moon is comparatively easy with gravity 1/6 as much as Earth's.  It's also quite possible to build a space elevator on the Moon, which can be powered with solar energy.  A space elevator on Earth is still science fiction because the material strength needed is ridiculous, plus there's problems with dealing with the atmosphere, but on the Moon it's actually quite doable, and we easily have materials with the needed tensile strength (we could probably build one on Mars too, though that'd be a bigger challenge than the Moon).  Build a space elevator on the Moon and now you have an easy way of lifting moon-granite into orbit, and it won't take much to transfer it over to Earth orbit, where all you have to do is figure out how to land it without burning it up in the atmosphere or making it into a meteorite.

"My boss and coworker are so difficult to work with.

My boss told me i arrive at work ""too early"" and it stresses my coworker (who has a longer shift so starts earlier) out. Wtf? I feel like it means my coworker is doing suspicious shit when shes alone... and my boss forgets things constantly and blames me for not telling her. I told her three weeks ago and then again a week after. Sorry i didnt nag and remind her again last week amd this week too, jfc...

My boss is sooo disorganized and bad at communicating. She would change the schedule and its contents and tell our clients but not me so i prepared based on the original schedule. So i arrive at work with no time to prepare for the new schedule. And i cant go to work early to prepare 😐 so all my clients expect the new contents but im like lol sry guyz original schedule today and new contents next meeting ok? Good thing my clients are awesome. They must be used to this bs.

My coworker is passive aggressive af. She refuses to speak more than a couple of words to me. When i ask her something she would just giggle and run away... wtf? 

Whenever she needs to tell me something she would tell my boss and my boss would text me what she said (boss works in a different office). I think my boss finally got tired of being the middleman so now my coworker leaves passive aggressive post its all over my desk.

I also caught my coworker looking through the open files on my desk a couple of times because since she refuses to talk to me so she doesnt just ask for them.

My desk is very minimal and super neat but every so often i would find my desk rearranged i guess to the way my coworker likes it 😑😑😑😑😑😑!!!! So i started stashing everything on my shelf and drawers instead of leaving next days work like i like so she would have nothing to rearrange but she always finds a way to rearrange my desk like moving my mouse off my mousepad wtf!!!

She also left a passive aggressive note saying to wash my own dishes (i only use cups in the office and i wash them!!). When i saw the note i just laughed. On that day during my break i left the office to buy my own tumbler so i would never use anything from the office again. One day i was leaving and she said i couldnt take my tumbler home and i told her it was my tumblr not the offices!! That was the longest conversation ive ever had with her. "

"Chemical weapons are often composed of two chemicals, stored separately, that only become lethal when mixed. Nonetheless, the army knows that leakage is possible with some weapons and have developed methods to prevent collateral damage —

&gt; the Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA)—an organization which uses science to combat WMD—has developed two ""agent defeat"" weapons to specifically to neutralize chemical and biological weapons without collateral damage.

&gt; The first one, known as BLU-119/B CrashPAD, was fielded during 2003 to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. This 2,000-pound Mk84 bomb comes loaded with a mix of high explosive and white phosphorus. The explosive ruptures drums or other containers while the phosphorus burns at high temperature, neutralizing the chemical agent.

"for a long time people used to say best buy was like a showroom for amazon. People used to go into best buy look at the electronics and buy at amazon at cheaper prices. 

However lately with people expecting things to be at their doorstep withing hours and best buy price matching on everything that's sold by amazon. Instant gratification is the name of the game. Amazon themselves ended up getting people addicted to 2 day and now even faster delivery.  Its almost a much better option to just go to best buy and price match and get the item you want almost instantly. Best buy performance in last 4-5 years has shown this. They are almost the only big electronics retailer thats present country wide. I think they have turned around pretty nicely. 

No surprise here that amazon is trying to get into brick and mortar stores and ended up cutting this deal with Best buy.  "

"&gt; Aren't you overgeneralizing things a little? None of these external shows have ""anti-establishment"" written in giant letters on their front - some of them are even very centrist and going on pro-establishment, the Jimmy Dore Show is a pretty strong outlier into the other direction

It's not just Jimmy Dore.

I also mentioned The Humanist Report.  Mike voted Jill Stein and defends his choice to this day.  He despises corporate Democrats.  He's vehemently anti-Russia-hysteria. There's nothing ""centrist"" about him.

Secular Talk has many other exceedingly non-centrist traits and gets his videos plucked up and put onto the very front of TYT.  Not even as a guest.  For example the video I mentioned earlier where YouTube tried to bury him, so TYT said fuck you and put him in literally the most prominent spot on their entire network with his video on Syria.

There's other prominent shows that are also very anti-establishment on the TYT network.  I'll name them if you'd like.

Again, I don't see how propping up these decidedly ant-establishment shows that are a thorn in the side of the corporate Democrat's agenda fits into your narrative.

&gt;From a business perspective, it's clear that TYT The Company just wants to imitate the bigger conglomerates (like CNN, MSNBC) as much as possible

Perhaps, and I hope they do from a business perspective and become mainstream ASAP.  That doesn't mean they are taking on the ideology of MSNBC or CNN by a long shot.

MSNBC or CNN wouldn't have a fraction of the stories that Cenk and Anna cover and/or would never cover them the same way.  They sure as hell won't have Jimmy Dore and the others have any kind of show on the air either.

I think being diligent and calling out TYT issues (Russia hysteria, for example) is important and necessary.  But, some of this just seems like a personal grudge of some sort instead of a balanced, constructive critique.

I call out TYT issues when I see them, but I also think it's prudent to notice the good they do instead of constantly leering at them with so much distrust where it's not warranted by evidence.

&gt;That's a truly exceptional occurence. They haven't done that for anyone else in response to the defunding, and they haven't repeated it for Secular Talk.

This is exactly my point from my last paragraph above.  You're looking for problems even when they do excellent things for the progressive movement.

It's not an exceptional occurrence.  Kyle has also been brought in as a co-host on the main show recently as well which is tremendous exposure for him and his show.  They also began having Jimmy Dore on the main show much more often after Google/YouTube began turning the screws on his show.

Also, look at Jimmy Dore's position on their network.  #1 top-left above everything else.  If the 20 million is contingent upon them pushing an establishment narrative they should get their money back ASAP.

Here you have a rabid (as in hell yes!), anti-establishment maniac who routinely calls corporate Democrats evil pieces of shit (which I agree with BTW) and he's top billing on their network being exposed to over 3.8 million subscribers.

https://i.imgur.com/IOqtMB6.jpg

You *should* notice he's not even the highest-subscribed channel, but they put his show ahead of the others anyway.  Ahead of literally ALL of the others to promote the living shit out of him.  And, by being there he's in position to garner vastly more subscribers.  This hardly fits your narrative.

Do you have any idea how much money that spot is worth?  Do you have any idea the vast millions TYT has to turn down on a ritual basis to corporate entities that would love to take that spot?

If TYT was as compromised as you infer they are, there's no way in hell they'd be exhibiting this behavior.

&gt;Sorry but you're still not getting it, despite my repeated attempts to explain it: these channels have to pay money - a recurring fee - to TYT in order to call themselves ""TYT Network"", not vice versa. It's not a lot of money, but they do.
They do not get any money from TYT, just access to a legal team.

You're attempting to explain how business works to someone that's consulted with Fortune 500 companies over decades.  I've been in the belly of the beast and have seen how some evil fuckers tick on a personal level.  TYT is not behaving like these corporate scumbags.

Respectfully, it's you that doesn't get it.  The massive exposure they get and huge resources and connections available to them (including the legal team) vastly outweighs the tiny ""fee"".

It's called massive [ROI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment) for people like Jimmy — and I don't see TYT prominently putting any pro-establishment lackeys ahead of Jimmy Dore that surely could afford to pay vastly more for that spot than he could.  He's very obviously been given that spot and the 20 million dollar investment isn't budging him.

Being a watch-dog of TYT behavior is needed.  As a matter of fact, Jimmy Dore has quite a few issues with his veracity on certain segments that I call out on occasion (as we should).  But there's a difference between being a watch-dog and an incessant naysayer with a grudge.

I want TYT to go mainstream as I see them carrying along folks with them that will make progressive issues go further mainstream.  They're an asset and frankly those of you that constantly shit on TYT and call it ""terrible"" aren't helping the progressive movement.

Constructive criticism is one thing, but purposefully finding a negative about every positive they do without proper weight is quite another.  (Here's looking at you Jamarl Thomas)

"&gt;Interesting. This is one by one what the Communist Party of China says and what Chinese kids learn in school. You don't happen to be with the Chinese navy, do you? If not just disregard this.

No I'm not affiliated with any Chinese asset, I'm someone like you who was appalled and outraged by what I'd heard and read about China and thought 'how could they be so backwards and barbaric?' until I actually took a step back and looked at the subject more in depth.

&gt;Yes, the old ""but others do it too"" argument. My five year old is a big fan.

It's not an 'others did it too', it's a fact of life. No country can go from nothing to a 'paragon of civilisation' without experiencing a hell of a lot of turbulence for many years before hand. Modern China is incredibly young, as in it has only got its shit together in the last few decades, you can't just buy your way to social, economic and political stability no matter how large your economy is. 

&gt;Are you in any position to have an opinion on the matter? Do you actually know much about the Chinese system? I mean it sure seems great according to what I read on the Telegraph and Buzzfeed but I'd like to know more.

You just singlehandedly destroyed your own argument. You're reading sensationalised headlines used to outrage and stoke fear in their target demographic, the world isn't the West and if you speak to the average Chinese citizen they will tell you that yes China has problems but it's not some backwards Hellhole. 

And finally, freedom is relative. There are lots of things you can do in China that you can't do in the US (What? You can't openly drink a can of beer in the street? What kind of backwards ass country is this?). 

I don't have anything else to say on the matter really; I couldn't care less if you think China is an evil backwards shithole, I just think your stance on the subject is incredibly ignorant of an entirely different culture. If you expect China to be an incredibly large Chinatown you'll be disappointed."

"&gt;You refuse to acknowledge facts (for whatever reason, I do not know). You therefore know very little about your investment. Banks are already adopting XRP via xRapid. Again, bear in mind xRapid is still in beta, and when it is out of beta, the banks currently using xCurrent can switch to xRapid - the incentive is faster transactions (from intraday to seconds), and up to 30% extra savings over xCurrent. No bribes necessary.

&gt;Liquidity is being built up daily. You're someone who sees a large building under construction and complaining that it's not ready today. Everyday, extra liquidity is added to XRP pairiings via new listings on exchanges. SBI VC alone - when launched this summer - would provide a ton of liquidity to the yen (If xRapid were ONLY successful in Japan, then that's huge in its own right and we would expect XRP's price to climb).

It seems you know nothing about how liquidity works, yet still insist on pretending to be an expert. SBI VC *can* add a lot of liquidity, but that requires, you know, actual volume, something that comes from more than just pilot programs. Moving corporate-size chunks of money is not just not feasible - great, SBI VC is adding liquidity to XRP - YEN but that's ONE currency, and you keep pretending like it's all in the bag right now. Even if they spend millions of their XRP (you know, the currency that Ripple currently hold +60% of), liquidity on the scale of global currencies isn't something you just buy your way into with a couple of millions dollars. I'm not saying it isn't doable, but you keep insisting that Ripples success is 100% guaranteed, NOTHING can go wrong, which is just so, so far from the truth.

"&gt; You can't actually get a HELOC until you have equity though, I believe.


This is correct. HELOC rules in Canada state that:

Mortgage + HELOC = max 80% LTV

This means that for a property valued at $234k, OP will not be able to access your HELOC until the mortgage is below $234k x 0.8 = $187,200.  And even then, OP will only be able to access the difference between that and the mortgage amount. For example, once the mortgage is down to $185k, OP could access $2200 under the HELOC. "

"I don't want to run my own business, I am not ""ambitious"", what you would call in capitalist terminology. Risk to reward ratio is only high at start of a business, and it reduces as business grows, this is a known statistics I would think.

Don't talk about Putin and Russians, all top richest people in the world, by far, are all in the US, all of them as capitalists.

The tax system, where taxation is minimal or none, is  as far as I recall, what all pro-capitalism (and especially capitalists) desire, is it not? And you are getting this slowly again, ever since the great depression in 1920's (or was it 30's) the tax was high for top income brackets, and has been reducing ever since, the only reason it got increased back then is because the, then US president, went to the top richest capitalists and told them that they will have to agree to be taxed more, of the people will riot and bring them down (the way Russians and French, and few others did) and so they agreed, so things calmed down for a while and got better, and then soon after WWII ended, communism and socialism became an evil enemy (even though they were allies fighting the Nazis in WWII, and may I add **the most** as worst fighting was on the Russian front where 1/2 of the 60 million people that died in WWII, were Russians), worker unions were attacked and workers started (again) losing their say in the economy, and ever since thins got worse.

yes, every society needs workers, in fact communist society makes everyone to have to work and contribute to society and no be a leech living of other people's work, which is what you have in capitalism.

Have you ever looked into worker co-ops? If not, look it up, maybe it will open your mind a bit and you can start to see what workers being their own masters, can achieve... and guess what... while capitalist system works only for the interests of the capitalists, communism, and worker co-ops can work for everyone (minus the capitalists that only look for opportunities to profit off of someone else's work, talent and so on)."

"Flippers buy homes below market value, generally those that don't qualify for financing. The improvements they make allow someone to buy it with a loan. That is what adds value, not the new stuff.

The 30% profit allows them to make money over time even when one deal might go south and cost way more than they thought.

"Look the answer I got:

Since you know that you cannot transmit the American citizenship to your child and you wish to apply for a temporary visa or an immigrant visa for her, a letter from the American Citizens Services section may be requested stating that the child does not have the right to the American citizenship. If this document is requested by the consular officer while applying for the visa, the ACS Section can issue an explanatory letter based on the information provided by you that must be submitted to the Visa Section, since visas cannot be issued to US citizens (or people that have the right of American citizenship).
1.      If you wish to have an official record, you will need to schedule an appointment to come to the Consulate, bringing all documentation required for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA). The ACS section will proceed with a citizenship check and provide you with an official document explaining that you do cannot transfer the American citizenship to your child. The CRBA fee will be charged.
 
2.      If you wish to have a regular registration, you will need to schedule an appointment to come to the Consulate and inform the consular officer that you cannot transfer the citizenship to your child because you have never lived in the United States and do not have the requirements for it. The ACS section, based on your affirmation will give you a simple explanatory letter. The section will not verify citizenship.
 
Both documents are valid if you want to apply for a visa for your child and you are questioned about the possibility of transmitting the citizenship. For both cases, you must schedule an appointment. Appointment must be done for a CRBA. Only you need attend the appointment.

So apparently you need a negative certification of U.S citizenship to apply for nonimmigrant Visa for a child with U.S citizen parent that do not meet statutory requirements for transition at birth. 

Self-declaration is not enough. You need an official to attest yr child cannot be a u.s citizen.

Whether this is legal or not. I don't know. Is definitely not clearly written anywhere.

Basically, although not written anywhere every child of a U.S citizen is obliged to apply for a CRBA.

Plus as I understand, a child without rights to citizenship at birth is a regular alien.

I wonder if the same logic would apply to a foreign spouse of U.S citizen, since apparently under ”possible claim” definition is included the naturalization by immigration visa.

"Tokyo. 

I lived both in the 23 wards (ward = borough), which is what most people consider ‘Tokyo proper’. I also worked in the most urban war of the 23. Before that, I also lived in one of the larger cities outside of 23 wards but still in Tokyo prefecture (state/county).

All-in-all, it was ridiculously quite. Anyone who has been to Japan will note that. Yes we have roving motorcycle gangs that rev their engines every couple of months, but not everyday. Yes, there are ambulances, sirens and fire trucks, but it just isn’t as loud. And yes very small parts of Tokyo can be loud...

For example, The Shibuya Scramble often has roving billboard trucks blaring the latest Jpop song or advertising a gym. But it’s the equivalent of Time’s Square. And it stops there. 

And if you ever go there, the trains are DEAD silent. Always. No one speaks as it’s seen as rude. And if people do speak, it’s in whispers or very low voices. 

When my family visited, I remember my cousin going “WOW ITS SO QUIET ON THIS TRAIN!!” In a normal American voice. Just. Loud. 

It makes me chuckle now. But at the time it was slightly embarrassing. 

But yes, overall, the country is just a lot quieter and calmer. And Tokyo, for its sheer size and density, is eerily quiet."

A lot of us supported that war because we trusted what the president and the intelligence community was telling us.

It wasn't true but we didn't know that until it was too late to go back.

"Interesting framework, nice work! I think choosing to abbreviate ""trustworthiness"" as ""trust"" harms understandability of your paper tho. What you're calling ""trustworthiness"", I'd call ""security"". People in the cryptocurrency community especially don't like systems that require a lot of trust because that almost always significantly degrades security.

Also, you left out a huge reason why people value Bitcoin: stability of monetary policy and especially it's eventual non-inflationary monetary policy.

And I'd recommend that you not use those abbreviations you're using (CR, DN, DNA) - they really hinder the ability to skim the paper. And even tho i caught the definitions of those things, it makes it much harder to read. Your non technical writeup doesn't even define DNA so i just thought you meant..

"Again a couple of noob questions.

1. Am currently invested through CAMS and Carvy through a broker who do investments behalf of me. Since all the ones in my portfolio are regular ones, shall I have to register in each MF website individually? Say one for ICICI, one for Birla and so on? Is the CAMS and KARVY do provide direct funds? If yes, can I just remove the broker and invest directly through CAMS? Am confused since you mentioned that common mandate is available in CAMS, and according to my understanding they only provide regular funds and not the direct fund. So that I should register with individual fund houses seperately and directly.

2. How the exit load is calculated. I understood that most of them are after 365 days and am not charged the 1% if I withdraw after 365 days. Since I am doing monthly investments, I have to wait 365 days after each cycle (like March + 365, April + 365 days) or what? If that's the case, I can withdraw each months amount by calculating the 365 days from each months cycle right? 

3. If I moved to direct plans, after investing a minimum lump sum amount, I can move my existing regular plans units to direct plans right?

Thanks for clarifying my questions.👍🏻"

That the ""bad/rough"" areas of town are no longer considered that way. Those areas had crimes committed from burglary to armed robbery to murder with a weapon. Those crimes are no longer prevalent in that area. Now to loop this back with the schools and other ""gun free zones."" Cant have a concealed weapon within 1000 feet of a school, unless occupant of household in that 1000 feet. That is a state law where i live I'm sure for other states as well. There are schools in those rough neighborhoods as i mentioned before that have cleaned up since the conceal carry opened up, however the schools have been broken into and vandalized, a minimal amount of robberies have happened. All within that 1000 feet. Mind you none have been armed. So why not have someone armed? "

There are thousands of reasons that Hannity could seem advice from Cohen. Heck, the reason is probably something I despise.

The chances that Hannity and Trump are connected in illegal activities simply because they shared the same lawyer for a very brief time are miniscule when weighed against the fact that Hannity could have gone to Cohen for **anything**.

"In the ‘50s and ‘60s there used to be an alley that ran between backyards in the neighborhood. I’m assuming this was when it was used. The alley is entirely impassable now, both ends completely capped with homes and the rest filled with trees and thicket, etc., so the overgrowth is not limited to around the hydrant in my yard. It’s 100 yards of dirt alleyway that’s been reclaimed by nature over several decades. My growth was obviously a bit worse since it was a foreclosure that sat for a long time, but the point remains.

"The problem is that Fox News really doesn’t lie very much. They have an extremely biased selection of content - ignoring anti-Trump news and heavily boosting pro-Trump news - and extremely awful and biased opinion pieces, but they don’t generally just out-and-out *lie*. Even when peddling ridiculous conspiracy theories, they don’t say “this is what happened” - they point out “interesting coincidences”, they “raise questions”, and so forth.

So requiring them to not lie wouldn’t really change much at all. They might have to be slightly more careful to frame certain things as opinions, but that’s about it."

"Tips from someone in the Seattle area, in the same situation:

1. You can go over appraised value / county loan limits as long as you can cover 25% of the difference. Talk to your lender!
2. Restrict your search to move-in ready, even if you have to ""downsize."" If your market is hot, people will bid up on a fixer-upper that you can afford into an zone that you can't afford. Fixer-uppers can get held up with the VA appraisal / MPR stuff, and other people who waive all contingencies and have cash in hand will look much more appealing. 
3. If you see a house that you think is move-in ready (aka. acceptable under the VA MPR rules) and you want to make a serious offer on, get an independent inspection prior to making the serious offer. We've found pest and mold hiding in charming houses that would have screwed us had we made the ""best offer.""
4. If at all possible, try to have a big chunk of EDM to release immediately, have your lender write a letter and make a phone call to the seller's agent to let them know that you are good for the offer. This lets people know that you're serious.

PS. We're ending up going with new construction with a builder because the listings that we want are getting bid up to the same cost as new construction, and then having extra required repairs after that."
"the biggest barrier to changing property lines is going to be the 'sellers' mortgage company. the mortgage is secured by the entire property. if they don't have a mortgage, no biggie, they can subdivide if the city/county will allow it, but if they have a mortgage, it's going to cost them money to do so. ie they have to get a new mortgage on the 'new' property.

if you don't already have an easement in place, that's probably the simplest way to make this happen."

"&gt;Enter the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which blue states are joining to commit to allocating their electoral votes to the national popular-vote winner -- regardless of their own state results.

Like thats the only reason they believe what they do? This isn't an attack. I'm just trying to understand what you're saying.  Yeah. More populous states tend to lean left.

"I find it extraordinary there are people that still believe Zimmerman was in the wrong, and Martin was innocent. 

&gt;The fact is that Zimmerman confronted a kid walking home with some Skittles. Zimmerman started a fight. He was not attacked.

Really. If Zimmerman started the fight, how do you explain Zimmerman's photographs of a swollen/broken nose, bloody lips and blood coming from the back of his skull (corroborated by multiple witnesses that Martin was the one beating up Zimmerman on the pavement), and the only injury on Martin's body is the gun shot wound in his chest and a ""small abrasion on his left ring finger."" 

What evidence do you have that Zimmerman was the one that started the fight and wasn't attacked?

&gt;I don't know the case law, but self defense seems to apply when a person is attacked, not when the attacker loses the fight. If someone is robbing a home and the homeowner pulls a gun on them, can the robber shoot the homeowner in self defense?

This is truly the pinnacle of insane justification. ""Yeah Zimmerman has no right to self defense because he totally started the fight."" Even if he's the only one that sustained injuries related to assault? Really? "

"Pushed out voters?  Trump barely outperformed Mitt Romney and McCain, and got 8 million fewer voters than Obama did in 2008, despite there being 50 million more registered voters today than there were back then.

Trump won because Democrats were not inspired by boring Hillary and stayed home in larger numbers than they generally do.  Republicans were positively excited to go run out and vote for a candidate who says out loud what they think in their heads or used to dog whistle.   The more motivated side wins (even if they lose the popular vote)."

So, what would the situation be, well, I live in a smallish town in US, to my knowledge there has never been an adult kidnapping for money here, since I've been alive which is over 40 years. There are known multimillionaires living around here already, and they drive nice cars, live in nice houses with a pool and tennis court. 

So, okay.. 1 I'm not to worried about it. 2. I would have several dogs at home, and a security system. 3. I would have firearms. 4. Most of my wealth Fiat and Bitcoin would not be readily available if it was worth that much. So, a person could not simply rob me for it. I assume if bitcoin were worth a 100K + easy solutions for that would come about. 5. I'd simply tell people I sold most of it and that is how I have my house and I invested the rest in bonds and stocks. "

"If you're going to waive or change the standard (in my area) language that says the seller has to deliver the place in the same condition, you would think that you'd include the what-if scenario. I think that's boilerplate in most state real estate contracts. 

But why would a buyer assume risk before closing? They can simply not close, it's not that hard to get out of a contract if you need. 

Earnest money is not cut and dried, in my area the title companies will just sit on it until buyer and seller agrees. So there could be a stalemate or legal challenge. It just seems like a bad idea to deviate from the norm that the seller is responsible for repairs/damage until closing. The buyer can't insure it until then, so, it's not logical to put it on the buyer. "

"No sir it won't be bcash holding it back, it will be consensus. While I agree that complete privacy is important to protect your wealth, transparency for all is a feature as well but can also easily be used against us. Theoretically though,  a government using BTC could prove if they are actually using funds where they said they would, show if they have accepted money from ""other"" sources, or stealing money. It basically can put those in power in check as well but this cannot happen with a tangible and completely private coin. Trust is removed for it's sake and now have to keep their word. 

Having a trust-less payment system is revolutionary and huge. Having a private coin with the characteristics of physical cash is also huge. Sadly, they are polar opposites. What improves one,  damages the other. Now that we know we can have multiple cryptos, there will be others, like me, will be okay with having both a trust-less currency and a private currency.

"I really don’t get this. Trump himself wants DACA reinstated - just not through executive order, which is probably illegal and what it was under thanks to Obama. Instead, he wants it through congress. He has opnely advocated for Reinstating DACA for a while now. It isn’t just Never Trumpers.

Edit: I also think I agree with reinstating DACA, but through Congress. I’m a little conflicted, but I err towards reinstating it. Why? Most of these people have been here for a long time and they’ve assimilated into the culture. My best friend is a Mexican living here in the US through DACA. His family owns two high-quality Mexican restaurants in my town. Very hard-working people and very much involved in the community. I suggest viewing these people as *individuals,* as opposed to proposing blanket citizenship or blanket deportation.Criminals should be deported. People showing their usefulness to society and willingness to assimilate - like my friend and his family - should be allowed to stay. Mass deportation of all of these people is impractical and not a wise political move."

"Ha! This is exactly what I though when I read the reply. Everyone these days wants to be offended at something or read something into something so they can wage debate.

I think you’re right. I think a lot of people believe in “something” but would rather put that they aren’t religious because they’re sick of the crap that comes along with organised religion. My brother is very much in that camp. Doesn’t mean everyone is. But some will be. 

Personally, I get frustrated with the fact that atheists claim moral and intellectual superiority when they themselves cannot know if there is a God or not. Especially when there are some very prominent scientists and mathematicians who are very religious yet believe in and study the tenets of science and make amazing breakthroughs. When a 16 year old atheist claims their atheism makes them intellectually cleverer than say a 60 year old biologist or physicist who has worked in the field for years and has a devout belief in God, i laugh inside.

"Most of my guys are immigrant workers. They are trade guys. They know everything there is to know about concrete or plumbing or steel, but couldn’t tell you how all these systems interface with each other. 
 For some, it’s a matter of training. These guys tend to rise to the level of foreman or other supervision role, but lack education to go beyond that. 

I don’t know how you move to an egalitarian society like you want when people like this exist. The current system makes their contributions valued, even if not to the same extent as mine.

As for electing leaders, I don’t think that would lead to better projects. Maybe nicer conditions for. A time, but we typically provide a safe project and the best conditions the market will bear. It’s not that we don’t want to provide the construction site version of the ritz, it’s that if we did, there wouldn’t be any project to even be worrying about. The project simply wouldn’t exist. 


I don’t want to presume anything about you, but if you’ve ever tried to organize anything at all involving more than a handful of people, you’d know that consensus is a pipe dream. Even more so when “the masses” include members of different education levels, socio-economic classes etc. it’s a disaster.

Our current system is flawed. On that we agree. I don’t believe yours will be better and actually think it will be far worse.


As in the other thread- it’s been a pleasure, but time to go do other things now.

"Another common one is ""I guess we should just do away with all laws then"". It's a pretty dumb argument because they are forgetting that every law has a risk vs reward element.

Some people speed because to them, the reward of getting somewhere a few minutes earlier outweighs the risk of being caught and given a ticket. Tons of people download shit illegally because the risk of being caught is slim to none.

Inner city gang bangers carry firearms illegally because the reward of being able to protect yourself from fellow criminals and being able to knock off rival members outweighs the risk of being caught. Also, if you are okay with committing murder, I'm assuming you are okay with taking part in an illegal straw purchase, carrying a firearm concealed without a permit, and being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm.

You could nearly eliminate speeding by raising the risk to something like: ""All speeders will be placed in stocks on the town square for 24hr"". Or even higher risk: ""All speeders will be shot on sight by an officer of the law"".

The same thing would apply to pretty much any law.

"I'm paying my taxes, begrudgingly.. But for some reason I don't feel that crypto should be taxed. It just doesn't connect in the same way that an investment in a company exists. I feel like this is beyond the realm of governments and borders. It's like trying to tax the oxygen that's in the airspace within the US borders.

Regardless of how silly the laws try to classify it.

For example, You ""must"" file an FBAR aka FinCen form 114 if you have had at least $10k worth of any asset or financial instrument in a foreign account at any given time in 2017 ( even if only for a minute ). So they are using this to say if you have transferred $10,001 worth of BTC from coinbase (USA) to binance (China) you are to report.

However, the problem is that bitcoin does not exist in the physical realm. There is no location for Bitcoin. It is  within a digital network and kept track of on ledgers across the globe. Therefore, there is no ""foreign account"" 

Btw, you ""must"" file a FATCA aka form 8938 if you had $50,000 in transactions on a ""foreign account""

Both of these things have extremely harsh penalties and I haven't heard anyone winning against the gov.

Penalties include: 
$10,000 fine if you failed to report because you didn't not know you had to 

$100,000 fine or 50% account value (whichever is greater) if you knowingly failed to report


Things to note:
FBAR is simply a report to notify the gov financial crimes department (FINCEN) and there are no taxes on these reports

FATCA is reported to the IRS "

"The problem is you’re misplacing the blame. Very, very few dealers are intentionally selling fentanyl as something else. Those that are deserve to go prison, you’ll find no disagreement from me there. But if you really want people to stop dying, what needs to happen is a full decriminalization of all drugs. Open testing sites where users can have their drugs tested for purity without fear of arrest or prosecution. Throwing users and random dealers in prison does absolutely nothing but cause suffering, crime and death; we’ve been doing it for decades and it clearly does not work."

You might start off with perfectly rational and consistent beliefs like that both the death penalty and abortion is fundamentally wrong. However, they are going to focus on abortion and ignore the death penalty until that objectioness turns to outrage and then they work so that your brain associates outrage with other things. 

Soon enough you're pavlov's dog drooling for the dinner bell, then for the door bell, then for the church bells, each passing bicycle's bell etc. You don't know why you drool more during Christmas season you just do. You've forgotten why the connection exists in the first place you just think it's natural to drool because one hears bells... that's the effect bells have. Soon you stop drooling because of food when no bells are present etc. Etc. Etc.

That's when you start protesting to kill more inmates to torture more people. All because you believed life was sacred. They have become experts at the Pavlovian manufacturing and weaponizing of outrage and frustration. Wonder why republicans hate liberals so much there you have it..."

"He might be dumber than Nixon, and so his crimes are less accomplished, but he still does not have anywhere close to the bodycount as that racist, amoral, paranoid, criminal, vengeful, bitter old fuck.

"&gt;All you needed for a mortgage was a pulse. Sometimes even that was optional. The bag boy at the supermarket was now a ""real estate investor"" and had 8 properties.

What is telling is that during the boom there were all these stories of small time speculators buying up 8 houses and flipping them, but far fewer stories of anyone building 8 houses. 

&gt;But accessibility to mortgages increases demand because otherwise unqualified buyers are now buyers. Were you around during the Real Estate Crash? 

Debt fueled demand exacerbated the problem of supply not rising to meet demand, but it didn't cause it. What we saw in the 2000s was a [temporary rapid acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis#/media/File:Subprime_mortgage_originations,_1996-2008.GIF) of a longer term trend. House prices have already recovered to pre-crash levels even with subprime mortgages dropping to a fraction of what they were.

Banks were lending out so much money for mortgages because the underlying supply constriction made housing very profitable to speculate on due to the feedback loop of buying houses -&gt; increases house prices -&gt; use increased value of housing to buy more houses. It was seen as a no-lose loan. Either the banks got paid back, or they got to repossess a house that had now increased significantly in value since the mortgage was issued so that it was now worth more than the mortgage. Of course that works great until you hand out so many loans that enough people defaulting can cause a short term spike in supply and drop in demand which bursts the bubble.

This was worsened by a misregulated and fraudulent secondary bubble in credit default swaps, which made banks confident that they had hedged the risk of defaults, but wasn't true because the true risk of the debt was being concealed and not being priced in. In fact it just made them over-leveraged in 2 bubbles instead of 1.

&gt;How many people would be buying houses this year if none of them could access a mortgage? What would happen to the median real estate prices?

There'd be a rapid crash in price to adjust to a sudden drop in demand for housing and then housing would continue to rise in cost because there would still be more demand for houses in the places people want to live than there is supply.

Even if you outlawed mortgage lending (effectively outlawing buying homes for anyone not rich enough to buy a house outright) it would just change from more people wanting to buy houses than there are houses to more people wanting to rent houses than there are houses, with a smaller number of wealthy landlords owning huge amounts of property they could buy outright rather than a larger number of small time landlords."

"That fork is only the catalyst. The reason people are buying is because of emotions. Many Bitcoin investors are getting impatient and frustrated with Bitcoin remaining stagnant while Bitcoin has repetitively shown gains of 20% everyday. Eventually, when the cryptocurrency market falls again in the new few weeks, Bcash will be the biggest loser. And it could happen exactly around or before the Bitcoin ABC fork being released on May 15th. Thus, I would not encourage anyone to believe to stick with Bcash until the fork is released. That’s purely speculation, you still have to be very cautious. "

"&gt; No disagreement at all over the facts - which point to zero mass shootings in Australia since 1996 by the available definition (created by the US). We can either use the common definition, or you can claim to be the authority and make something up. I don't see that as semantics.

No one can possibly be this dumb.  You have to be trolling.

From your earlier comment:

""Since we're cut/pasting from Wiki... The United States' Congressional Research Service acknowledges that there is not a broadly accepted definition, and defines a **""public mass shooting""[2] as one in which four or more people selected indiscriminately, not including the perpetrator, are killed or wounded.** How many mass shootings does that make it again?""

Your preferred definition says mass shootings is four or more dead or wounded.  

My examples, Monash - 2 dead/5 five wounded = 7 total, Hectorville - 3 dead, 3 wounded = 6 total, Hunt - 4 dead.

EVERY. SINGLE. EXAMPLE. matches your preferred definition of 'mass shooting'.  You can't even be bothered to read the responses to your comments.

&gt;You say it's dumb to argue over the deaths per capita but if you're going to argue that any shooting is bad in the case of 3 incidents listed that are not mass gun murders in Australia over that 22 year period then we really need to be comparing apples with apples - and there are events as bad or worse than the ones you mentioned in the US just about weekly on average. Is it dumb to suggest that exponentially more people dying is a worse scenario?

You had to lie (and still lie) about the number of mass shootings to illustrate your point about Australia.  My comment about the 'dumb comebacks' you have so cleverly regurgitated was to point out that as soon as you were proven wrong - and you were proven wrong with every single example I provided - you would deflect into some other tangential argument.  Which is exactly what you have done.

Read the entire argument before replying next time.

"Yeah we already sent them the pre approval from the bank and the appraisal/inspection went okay so the loan is being finalized.

We had to send the proof of funds to the bank to get the preapproval so hopefully they know that we would have had to have the funds to get the pre approval for a 20% down payment loan.

"Meh. Lowest rate is not always the best. You have to factor the APR, truthfully \- a lower rate could come with a higher origination fee or points and turn out to have a poor recoup timeline.

&gt; Only once a majority of nodes approve the snap and reach consensus can the snap be added to the snap-chain. If majority consensus is to reject the snap, it cannot be added to the snap-chain.

How does the majority ""reach consensus""? The problem of decentralized consensus is the critical problem that Bitcoin (and blockchain in general) solves.

If you have an isolated node that adheres to a different version of the protocol, then that node is quickly isolated since the updates it forwards are not transmitted by other nodes if it breaks the majority protocol. However, if there are 2 non-negligible sets of nodes and each set is well connected, you get into a situation where each set continuously tries to forward a chain that is invalid to the other set.

Furthermore, only relying on nodes to determine the valid state of the chain leaves you open to Sybil attacks.

Anyway, mining is a crucial component of the blockchain (at least in the way that Bitcoin uses it) and that's left out of the explanation, as you already remarked.

I don't think blockchain technology is very ELI5-compatible, as smart as some 5 year olds are. And that's OK. Not everything in the world can easily be dumbed down to a low enough level while still retaining accuracy and correctness. It's also not necessary for someone to know how a blockchain works, it's far more important that people know what the properties and advantages of a blockchain are. And that is something that you can relatively easily ELI5."

"Man there is some bad advice on here. Do you want to buy this house? LPS Field Services appears to be a maintenance company that works for loan servicers. If a loan servicer is taking care of the property it is probably REO, which means it's been repossessed by the bank. A title search would tell you what bank owns it. They would refer you to their servicer. Depending on who that is it might be listed on their website. You can search by address. If they're like most loan servicers, they suck. They will not call you back and getting the asset manager on the phone will be really difficult. What I like to do is to file some OPRA requests with the township and ask for violations. If there is a violation and the house is owned by a bank they have the servicer send an attorney. I have the best luck when I find that attorney and then ask him who to deal with. He can direct you to the asset manager. That person can tell you what's going on. If you want to buy it they can usually tell you who they are going to list it with. This guy usually is overworked and covers a huge area selling junk houses. If you just want something to be done about the rats/eyesore you can tell the asset manager what's going on and he can put in a work order. I would tell him you plan on calling code enforcement regularly if nothing is done. threatening to call code enforcement unless they sell to you probably won't work. "

"Again, you haven't addressed the point.  The token is just a method for representing a trade.  Gold works as a token of sorts, but the problem is if the token becomes too valuable it stops being good at representing small trades and becomes a less efficient token.  If you have no other tokens to use, this can slow down trade as the double coincidence of wants comes into play.

If, however, that token can divide infinitely, it's value can now grow infinitely with no detrimental effect on trade.

Of *course* the number of decimal places is arbitrary.  It's the potential to expand and contract based on the economy's need that makes it better than gold as a commodity-as-a-currency.

My whole point is that the inflation model of the US dollar is an attempt to address this; if the dollar gets too valuable, it stops being useful.  Since our goal is to grow our economy, without inflation this will inevitably happen to the dollar too.  Therefore they need inflation to keep the US dollar from experiencing this problem.  We *want* the US dollar to lose little bits of value over time so it doesn't force an economic contraction due to a loss of liquidity (like we experienced with gold).  Bitcoin doesn't have this problem.

"
"&gt; In fact, it's been getting a lot cheaper for banks to provide services in the past 20 years, which is why you now have free bank accounts, free transactions, free pretty much everything that you want from a bank, thanks to competition.

Off course I can have a free bank account when the bank gives me a 0.2% interest for the money in my account and they lend my money for 6-7% interest. But try to make a wire transfer between the US, the UK, and EU, and you'll see how many fees and commissions you'll be charged and how many days it takes.

I know that Bitcoin's volatility is a problem if it wants to be a store of value, but so far it only went up long term, and volatility is getting lower and lower with adoption so there will be a time when Bitcoin's volatility will be comparable to USD or GBP

Then ours went up nicely staged and had 11 offers within three days. Realtor got overwhelmed and shut down offers. Redfin said ours was 99% likely to sell faster than nearby homes.

Feedback from potential buyers was that the other unit was uncomfortable to tour because tenants still lived there, despite its upgrades. What's more, it only had a 1-car garage. Plus our private end unit plus huge yard was way more desirable.

If anything, their listing gave us more traffic. We had 4-5 couples at any given time touring condo over two open house days. One stayed five hours.

We finally accepted an offer $45k over asking. We did have several cash buyers but they were $15k below that. And this was a 25-yo condo that is all original except tile and carpet.

"&gt; Ah yes 'corporatism', the word people throw around to shutdown conversation and cue people to feel outrage

You could say the same about:

- Conservatism
- Liberalism

All of those terms are used to describe **orientation** (a general policy direction someone tends to favor) while others interpret it as a policy **position** (i.e. set of tenets X, Y, Z, etc.) and vice versa. The words themselves are vague enough to be unclear about which meaning is being invoked, inviting misinterpretation.

Doesn't mean you **have** to misinterpret it though. Generally speaking, Clinton favored deregulation and disfavored labor - in a directional sense, that puts him as pro-corporation in my book.

No one is arguing that conservatives aren't pursuing things that help corporations and screw labor, nor is anyone saying they haven't made strides in that direction. What we're saying is that Bill Clinton **also** made some strides - small ones, perhaps, but still in that direction. And no, justice appointments and resulting court decisions are not the only things politicians do that have impact. There's much more to look at."

"Okay, so there's a lot here that's actually *not* partisan. The question of whether the SP should be handling this case is what's at stake here, and it seems like the judge wouldn't be *dropping* the charges so much as moving them to the appropriate jurisdiction. From what I gather the reason that the judge is skeptical here, and the reason that Mueller and his team want to prosecute this, is to give them leverage for a plea deal to flip Manafort, not because it's specifically under Mueller's jurisdiction. 

One issue is that it takes away leverage for Mueller to flip Manafort because it not only takes it out of his hands to prosecute or reach a plea deal, but it also raises the probability that the president can pardon him without dealing with any obstruction charges. Even though the charges in NY are still there, Manafort can deal with the Virginia charges separately hoping that the president has his back.

Another issue is that it raises questions about the scope of Mueller's authority. We saw that he handed over the investigation and prosecution of Cohen to the SDNY, so he certainly understands that he didn't have jurisdiction there. But on the same hand applying the logic of what I said above regarding leverage, Mueller gave that up by handing it over... and we're most likely talking about the two players who have the most ""dirt"" on the president as it stands. That said, I think Mueller probably thinks (or knows) that Manafort is the one of the two which will be more beneficial for their overall case, which might be why they want to hold on to his case over Cohen's.

"As a senior in college, I was elected by my professors to take part in a crossfire debate panel that was televised locally. I was to debate against another student, environmental lawyer and a local politician about global warming, taking the position that it was a man made phenomena. I had a team of 12 student researchers dropping off a giant research binder weekly, full of journal articles and studies regarding global warming.

The further I dug, the harder it became to argue for a man made component. I found myself very conflicted as there was far more evidence linking the recent (several decades) rise in global temperature change to historical patterns. I was completely convinced going in that we, as humans, are responsible for global warming. I finished, however, convinced that while we may play some small part in global warming, the role we play is very minuscule in comparison with historical temperature fluctuations.

This was ten years ago so my ability to debate this at the level I did is gone, but I highly encourage extensive research into historical warming trends throughout the past millennia."
"We should defend our national interests.  Where our national interests are not under threat or endangered, that's not our problem.

"Gold and taco sauce packets...  currencies for the future.

Imagine we are all sitting around the postapocalyptic campfire roasting some vermin...

Billy has his firearms and ammo stash, we can hunt and protect ourselves, Billy did it right.

Johnny has the taco sauce packets he hoarded for 20 years... about 2 years after d-day all the towns and supermarkets were cleaned out; There is no global trade, no spices or seasonings left, and ‘fire roasted rat’ tastes mighty bland, we break out a packet on special occasions where we want to remember what seasoned food tasted like.  Johnny did it right.

Donny collected gold and silver, For years he put 10% of his pay away into precious metals hoarded in his basement, we melt these down, cut into pieces, or shave them off and use them as a known value method of exchange / currency.  None of the paper or coin money has any value now.  Donny did it right.

Joey...  well Joey spends his days attempting to cobble together enough computer equipment to achieve a workable LAN, to which he is trying to attach a full BTC node, in hope to someday be able to extract the Bitcoin he had sitting in the lightning network...  He says that once he gets the BTC out of the lightning network that we can now send these virtual coins back-and-forth to each other across this LAN.  Numbers on a computer screen!  He tries every wireless router he can locate in hopes of being able to send these numbers ‘wirelessly’ someday.  He often goes off about how some of his coins were on the ‘verge’ of ‘taking off’ when the bomb dropped...  did Joey do it right?

I suppose the takeaway is that various scenarios paint different pictures as to what might be important in the future. ;)"

Bitcoin is not an investment.  It is a new financial system.  One in which financial “experts” who have been stealing from the masses for generations with fractional reserve banking and inflation have no place.  Get used to it.  The fire sticks are on top of the hill as we speak.  

And remember, that financial Mecca you hold dear was first a tiny capital (acquired with wampum) of a backwater nation that began with an ideal among some farmers ruled by the iron fist of a tyrant.  Ideas matter.  It was King George who should have questioned his own bearings, not George Washington or Alexander Hamilton or Thomas Jefferson or James Madison - the zealots with their silly ideas.

That you think this whole thing means speeding up your back office suggests you have been listening to a little too much Jamie Dimon bullshit and don’t actually have a clue what you are talking about.   Blockchain without decentralization and trustlessness is just a database.  The secret sauce is the other stuff.  Read up a little.  And think for yourself.

"I commented in the other thread but figured I would address it here to.  How much did you pay for that option?  The 1.68/share is NOT the price you pay for 1 share of fb.  That is the premium charge for that option to buy 1 share.  All that number does is show the intrinsic value of the contract.  Lets talk about what happens on 4/20.  FB stock is sitting pretty at $171 per share.  That is above your break even point! Your contract would be worth about $3/share, or $300 (meaning you sell the contract and you made 132 profit off your 168 investment).

If you had bank rolls of capital, you could exercise the option yourself and buy 100 shares of FB for 16800 (assuming your strike price was 168) and then turn around and sell them instantly for 17100.  That would net you 300 in profit instead of 132 but you also had to use a LOT MORE CAPITAL.

At the end of the day, Robinhood will sell your option contract as long as it is ITM (in the money).  Basically if you don't pay attention, and the call option has value, robinhood isn't going to dick you over by letting it expire because you forgot to sell it.

Comey never authorized disclosing that investigation's existence, even before Congress in his testimony. But in the OIG report you can see McCabe furious at the NY Field Office of the FBI for leaking like a sieve on that investigation *and* being pissed off at DOJ for putting pressure at the FBI on shutting down a validly predicated investigation. (For reference, the FBI shuts down investigations that have no valid predicate after 6 months.)

In the middle of all that, there were leaks against McCabe personally (on his wife's run and the now well known McAuliffe donations) from people within the FBI and in an effort to correct the record, McCabe ended up confirming the investigation's existence. That was a blunder, and I won't conclude like OIG did that it was McCabe putting his personal interest above the public interest, I think he could too easily argue that it was putting the FBI interest above everyone else to just tell the truth. The issue was I think that he authorized those disclosures (which he did have the authority to do on his own, just like Comey) without Comey's okay and Comey's recollection of events didn't match up with his.

"Keep a little perspective though. $900 a month in 1988 is the equivalent of $2000 today when accounting for inflation. Sure, prices have outpaced inflation for the past 10-15 years but a large reason for that was a big influx of net new residents into the city, combined with available housing stock not keeping pace which created a housing shortage. The last two to three years though the amount of new housing coming online has actually outpaced demand and average rents are actually falling across the city in a lot of neighborhoods, albeit not a whole lot. That’s a hell of a lot better than the 5% or more a year increase we’d been accustomed to."

"I don't see Vermont flipping red. Except for two or three of the least populated counties (Northeast Kingdom) Vermont is essentially a one party (Democrat) state, with a strong third party called the Progressive Party. Even with every Republican in the House and Senate, and even a few Democrats (including one of the original sponsors of the bill) voting against S. 55, they couldn't stop this bill- Republicans are vastly outnumbered. Very few folks are left in Vermont whose families have been there more than a generation or two. A little over 50% of the sitting legislators were born and raised outside of the state (usually MA, NY, NJ, CT etc). The culture of multigenerational Vermont families is gone, most likely never to return. Folks who have moved in from elsewhere have essentially turned Vermont into a theme park based on their idea of some bucolic socialist ecotopia. A Vermont for Vermonters disappeared permanently decades ago. I would mark the beginning of the end back when Act 250 was passed. Vermont culture is a new Vermont culture, arisen in the last thirty years or so, and it is not the culture of the families who have worked the land and hunted the forests since the nineteenth century."

True.  You used a qualifier, for the 2nd time.  This way the term become means ""begin to be.""  Even you know that is the normal definition of the word.

Also True.

1.  So let's just agree that Bush did not begin to be president in 2005.  

2.  And let's also agree that ""begin to be"" is the most common meaning of the word ""became"".

&gt; Coal plant emissions damage infant DNA, a new study shows


&gt; A study from Columbia University has found notable differences in the DNA of neonatal babies born after a coal plant in China was shut down, compared with babies born in the same place while the plant was still operating and polluting the surrounding air.


&gt; Dr. Frederica Perera and Dr. Deliang Tang, researchers at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, found that babies born during the coal plant’s operation had shorter telomeres than those born after the plant’s closure — a result which seemed to validate the Chinese government's push to reduce air pollution.

Shorter telomere length in cord blood associated with prenatal air pollution exposure: Benefits of intervention,

Highlights

• Compared telomere length (TL) in babies born before and after a coal plant shutdown.

• Prenatal exposure coal pollutants (PAH) estimated by cord PAH-DNA adducts.

• Shorter TL previously associated with certain adverse health outcomes in adults.

• PAH-DNA adducts in cord blood associated with shorter TL.

• The second (post- intervention) cohort had significantly longer TL compared to the first.

Abstract

Background

To examine the molecular benefits of the government action to close the local coal burning power plant in Tongliang County, Chongqing Municipality, we compared biologic markers and health outcomes in two successive birth cohorts enrolled before and after the plant was shut down. In this city, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were primarily emitted by the coal burning facility. We previously reported that cord blood levels of PAH-DNA adducts (a biomarker of exposure) and various adverse health outcomes were reduced in the second cohort, whereas levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor/BDNF (a protein involved in neuronal growth) were increased. Here we assessed telomere length (TL), which has been associated with risk of certain chronic diseases, early mortality, aging and cognitive decline in adults.

Objectives

The goals of the present study were to determine whether TL differed between the two cohorts and whether prenatal PAH exposure, estimated by PAH-DNA adducts in cord white blood cells of newborns in China, were predictive of shorter TL in cord blood, suggesting the potential accrual of risk of certain chronic diseases during the prenatal period. We explored relationships of TL with BDNF and neurodevelopmental outcomes, each previously associated with PAH-DNA adducts in these cohorts, as well as the potential mediating role of TL in the associations between adducts and neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Methods

We analyzed TL in cord blood of 255 newborns who also had data on PAH-DNA adducts, BDNF, and relevant covariates. Multiple regression analysis was carried out to test associations between adducts and TL and between TL and BDNF, adjusting for relevant covariates. In the subset with developmental quotient (DQ) scores from Gesell testing at age 2 (N = 210), we explored whether TL was a mediator of the relationship between PAH-DNA adducts and DQ scores by first examining the associations between cord adducts and DQ, cord adducts and TL, and TL and DQ, adjusting for the same covariates.

Results

As hypothesized, the mean TL was significantly higher in the second cohort compared to the first cohort. Overall, PAH-DNA cord adducts were significantly and inversely correlated with TL. Multiple regression analysis showed a significant association between adducts and TL, after adjusting for key covariates: β (effect size per standard deviation adducts) = −0.019, p = .003. The regression coefficient of TL on (Ln) BDNF was also significant (β = 0.167, p &lt; .001). Exploratory analysis, regressing TL on Gesell developmental scores, showed generally inverse, but not significant associations. TL was not, therefore, deemed to be a potential mediator of the association between adducts and developmental scores at age two.

Conclusion

This study provides the first evidence that prenatal PAH exposure from coal burning may adversely affect TL, with potential implications for future risk of chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease. The improvement in TL in the second cohort and the observed correlation between increased TL and higher levels of BDNF indicate direct benefits to the health and development of children resulting from the government's closure of the power plant."

"Well that's an emotionally loaded question, but yes I would be, provided that everyone understands the consequences of their actions.  I'm not willing to start down the path of telling people that they can or cannot engage in activities with simply because I find some acts ""yucky.""

We find these acts reprehensible for multiple reasons, the two primary of which are biological and moral.  Biologically the revulsion is pragmatic; people who are repulsed by close relatives are less likely to produce unhealthy offspring.

So if you counter with ""Such unions are significantly more likely to produce deformed or unhealthy offspring"" then I ask you, are you ok with genetically testing all straight couples prior to their engagement in sexual intercourse and preventing those who are likely to produce progeny with a significant hereditary illness from participating in unprotected intercourse?  Personally, I'm not okay with this, so I don't find this argument to be particularly compelling.

The moral reason is more complex.  We view sexual relationships in which one party has significant coercive ability over the other party to be reprehensible.  This would be true of any union in which one party is still close to adolescence and the other is more than a generation older.  Parents generally have significant coercive ability over their children, so we view this extreme betrayal of a parent's trust through coercion as particularly reprehensible.  But if the mother and son or father and daughter did not know that they were related, chose to couple, and *then* discovered their relation and decided not to terminate their relationship, then that is their right as adults.

For these incestual relationships, if a romantic or sexual relationship began in childhood then of course the parent should be held criminally accountable, even if this is discovered into adulthood and the son or daughter now views the relationship as consensual.

How to determine this, and where burden of proof would be, I don't know because I'm not a lawyer.  Presumably such charges could be investigated by the appropriate agencies and prosecuted in criminal courts.

While sex with a 10 year old is still pretty bad, apperently it's not treated as severely as forced sex with a 10 year old,  even though a 10 year old should not be trusted to make such a decision and therefor the punishment should be harsher.

Finland's prosecutors now have to fight to make the law stricter as a result.

Monetary inflation specifically refers to the base money supply only.

When most people refer to inflation in mainstream usage, they are typically referring to price inflation. When people refer to inflation on /r/bitcoin, they're referring to the more narrowly defined monetary inflation.

"But the facts HAVE changed for this guy. There's a whole slew of assumptions about the facts which he now has good reason to question.

At one time he probably assumed these protestors who previously he was well-disposed towards were at least somewhat fair-minded, were justified in their actions and that the targets of their protests deserved it... now all those facts which were the premises for a lot of conclusions are now demonstrably proven false in his case... in the light of this new information he is forced to rethink the conclusions. He may additionally start rethinking a lot of other facts he had previously taken for granted.

And of course we're not purely rational creatures. People he thought were friends turn on him. Many people who he thought were enemies express sympathy for him. Even without any change in the ""facts"" that will have a huge impact on his sympathies, on who he listens to and who he trusts.

The testimony of people in situations like this who have changed their world-view is that it's not an overnight switch from one to the other. They come away from an event with their opinions of groups and individuals changed but their conclusions on policies and ideas remain intact... at first. But they are now willing to listen to arguments that they had previously dismissed out of hand. They are now less sympathetic to the people making one argument and a little more sympathetic to some of the people on the other side of it... they come to realize that it was NEVER as black and white as they had previously thought. Slowly they become more convinced by the arguments of new people who treat them with respect and sympathy and less convinced by the arguments of people who treat them with hostility and harassment. Five to ten years later his opinions are very different than they had been."

Heart is super salty about himself right now it seems. He originally called that you can 2x trade Bitcoin, because it never loses more than 50%. He was wrong. Then he claimed all these ludicrious things about how there's no support left and all that shit. Price got to his head. 



Tone is a tool, that's all you need to know. 



TA is bullshit, but very popular in times like these, when we go sideways and go through re-test of older lower levels, nothing happens, so people look for indicators saying whether it's moving anytime soon or not. 


I'm a fan of simple logic when doing TA. We're still under 200 day, confidence is low, thus volume and interest are also low. We couldn't hold that level before, and hopefulyl we can this time around. RSI on daily indicates we're still not overbought.

"It depends on your particular routing.

If you only have a single channel, if the server is congested or busy, the LN Node can have a delay. Or, if their channel on the other side is low, they may need to do some balancing also. Also, while it's in beta, some nodes are not configured right. This means after 5 seconds, it tries another routing method, and another, and another, until it finds a route that works.

BitRefill also needs to process and save, they may have a system to back up channel state before responding with a ""Received"" signal, because unlike on-chain, where you can send to someone offline, LN requires the other end to be online. This means the other end's lag or congestion will affect anyone sending to them. 

If you use 2 channels, it will be faster, or you can wait until the network grows. Sometimes they can take up to 30 seconds to route, because the network doesn't route.

Also, routing algorithms take a LOT of CPU power, so an older phone will take up to a minute. It has exponentially high amount of possible routes which it needs to figure out. It's quite similar to Google Maps mapping algorithm, which can take a phone 30 seconds to calculate, but the server does in a second. But that's why when offline, Google Maps takes the simple route with freeways and main roads, and takes longer.

"Well, your final point sums up the difference in perspective. I place value on conscious experience, while you don't. You are happy to erase all conscious experience from existence because ""as long as stuff looks like it's having conscious experience, who cares"" (incidentally, nothing ""looks like"" conscious experience when there is no conscious experience left); I see this as a bizarre, self-destructive viewpoint of a culture disconnected from what it means to be alive; meaning inheres in irrational relations and lived experience, not in bare computation and the appearance of meaning (social media, anyone?) The former may emerge from the latter (debateable), but I don't see any reason to discard conscious experience other than an impotent nihilism. Clearly you got something out of this discussion - else why have it? If not, why not end it all now, if conscious experience is of no value?

Since this is the environment subreddit, here's another example - How would you feel if we wiped out all life on Earth and replaced it with robots? Robot bees, robot elephants, robot fish, robot people. Better? Worse? Don't care? I'd think that, intuitively, most people would find this an unattractive option, which leads me to believe there is something valuable about conscious experience. Hence the concern with the environment in the first place, since this is not really a concern for the environment *itself*, but a concern for the preservation of life, and thus consciousness, on planet Earth."

"&gt; I've heard a few real estate agents say ""no, leave it as-is and sell it"" but as I looked further into it, I suspect that's because they wanted to invest the $20k for $50k back themselves and flip it. I can't be sure though and would like advice.

No conspiracy among the agents. They're aware of the HGTV Effect. Everyone thinks they can be a flipper &amp; wants to flip to themselves to accomplish both the ""zomg get rich"" and ""we need a nest"" goals at once. Demand drives prices, and these dumb tv shows drive demand for neglected ""Granny Houses."" At this point I get ""we want to buy a fixer upper to make our own"" calls AT LEAST as often as I get ""we want to buy a turnkey house to move into immediately"" calls. 

Fix the deck so it's not a safety hazard and is in bare minimum condition to get a normal mortgage, and let someone overpay (relative to property condition &amp; what it would cost to remediate) who thinks they are going to be the next overnight millionaire from real estate. 

I say this kind of like I'm making fun of these potential buyers subject to the HGTV Effect, but my wife and I bought a neglected ""Granny House"" for our first home ourselves. Wifey got her dream kitchen, though, among other things. No way in hell the market will pay back what we put into it, which we knew going into it, but we enjoy it and are overall happy with everything. "
"It should be, but it's not always the case.

Some people get emotionally attached to a house they want, and want to pay more than what it's worth, so in that situation, sales price would be higher than appraised value.

On the flip side, other people might just want to sell a house as quick as possible and don't really care (they might have inherited a property across the country and just want money asap) so in that case, the sales price might be lower than the appraised value.

So with those two scenarios in mind, the bank will need a 3rd party report (appraiser) to assist them on whether the loan they are giving is worth approving for a particular property."

"while it seems like a joke from that side, its not a joke from the buyer side.  

You are correct the person being foreclosed on probably can't come up with that cash that fast, but somone else can!  

so say there is a 60 day right of redemption.  Well I let my 300k house go to shit and get forclosed on and it sold at auction for 125k.  Some poor sap doesn't understand auctions and he dumps 100k into it to bring it up and figures he is about to sell it for 300k and get a huge payday!  

Thats until the deadbeat that got foreclosed on sells their right of redemption for $10k to some guy he barely knows who does have cash.  Dude pays off the mortgage and pockets that 100k you just spent.  

Or the buyer had to wait 60 days to make an investment here and pay the holding costs there.

you forced millions on to healthcare while not increasing the supply of doctors, simple supply and demand, also medicine cost is higher in the us because the us produces brand new medicine yearly for treatment meanwhile no shit other countries just steal the patents on the drugs and sell them as generics. yes, this is an oversimplification but a valid one. one of the simplest things to increase the supply of doctors is to do away with med boards. and simply just let medical students do an internship at local hospitals and if they do ok let them become doctors, it will suck for doctors because their salaries would go down because of the increase of them, but it will be good for the rest of the US.

"We bought a house recently using Redfin and would do the same again in a heartbeat. We started looking with a traditional realtor and it was a bad experience. As they are commission based they have a big incentive to make the sale and came over as too pushy (like many on this Reddit). At redfin they are more task oriented so they aren't pushy.  They never helped set up ""zones"" we did all that ourselves and just used the app to get alerts and schedule tours etc after meeting our realtor at the beginning, most tours were with unlicensed associates who were sometimes working for Redfin as a side gig but often provided interesting insights due to their different backgrounds. Great process for us. If you want or need more hand holding by an agent which it sounds you do then maybe consider an agent. 

A friend recently bought a house in Denver, made an offer after the agent toured the house on Skype and put in an offer from another state. She had a close personal relationship with that one agent and was definitely in a situation that I would not recommend using Redfin. For the majority of people who have any idea how to use modern technology and have the time to put in a little effort yourself I think Redfin is a great idea.

No, Armalite never marketed the AR-15 to the civilian market, nor was it designed with the civilian market in mind. Colt did eventually offer a semi-only version for civilian sale, but that was (obviously) after Colt bought the rights from Armalite.

The article doesn't say what the post title says at all.

Welcome to New York! Lol
"I'm going to play a bit of devil's advocate I guess because I think the realtor maybe onto something.  I'm a realtor in Nashville, and I understand the predicament.

You mentioned your friends and others felt being underpriced, but went over easily.  Was the final price higher or lower than what they intended to sell for?

Pricing is very tricky because it's not in a vacuum.  If you price it at 399, it exposes it to all the people that have 400k as the cut off, but still captures the 410k+ market.  It's unlikely someone is looking for a strict range of 400-420k.  So even if you are good to go at 420k, you will look at a home at 399.  

The tricky part is reading the market.  If it's hot, and priced right, then it will go above asking.  Home buying is very much an emotional process.  You want as much exposure to get a few people to be attached.  Those people don't want to lose attachment, and will bid higher.  Unfortunately, if the market is cold then it won't work as well.  I can't tell without knowing market and agent.

You don't have to accept offers since they are just offers.  You can also take the house off the market and raise the price.  It doesn't strictly have to come down.  

I would suggest you list at 399 (assuming hot market, if not throw this all out), stage the house for 10 days.  After 10 days, look at the offers.  If all are low-ball offers, pull the listing.  Put it back on the market.  If people ask why you raised it, you are always entitled to ""we had people give opinions it was valued higher and here we are"".  You don't have to justify the raise unless it's completely ridiculous like a million.  As long as the comps are close, it's within your realm of possibilities.  This way, you are exposed to the 399 crowd as your realtor mentioned, but you don't have the stigma of a price reduction.  If the exposure doesn't yield results, go up and now you are in your desired price range.

A few factors for my advice:

1. Little kids and clean houses rarely go together.  Messy homes and full price rarely go together as well because people think ""if they neglected to clean, what else did they neglect?"". You want to sell the house quickly for the highest price but also keep your sanity.   Although I don't know your kids, they could be absolute clean.  I'm basing off on ones I've seen.

2.  The extra expense of staying longer adds up, and you don't want it to drag too long.  

3.  One of the biggest parts of business is drawing people in, and then upselling once emotionally invested.  You will see this the most clearly with car sales, where people draw you in with basic model prices, only to have you spend money on upgrades.  

4.  You aptly described it as an art and it's something that a lot of folks can't pull off.  So this is where knowing the competence level of the agent would help.   And it's not straight intelligence like I expect her to win Jeopardy.  It's recognizing the flows of the market and adjusting like an art form.

5.  I don't recall you mentioning your housing plans afterwards.  How does the timing of sale effect that decision? Are you staying in an apartment? In city? In state? Moving to Nashville (in that case, Hi! Lol)? Moving elsewhere?  Does that timing impact your post sale plan?

One more advice: Get professional pictures, and if possible get a 360 camera view for the house.  You don't want to constantly go out of your home for every viewing with your family.  You want people to have a very good idea of the home before they visit.  You want confirmation visits instead of curiosity visits.  

Good luck!"

"It's an imperative that we go into space, but as I said, our government isn't putting anywhere near the resources into as we should be. You might say we don't ""need"" to go into space, but I actually disagree. You can say that about all kinds of things throughout history which at the time people would say we didn't ""need"" to do, but today would be looked at as pivotal endeavors in human history. I'd also say that humans have an inmate need to explore and advance our technology. It's partially what sets us apart from other animals.

I also don't think it's a waste of captlial because it employs lots of people in a field that advances our species. It will employ even more people in the future. There are plenty of billionaires who do far less to advance our species or improve the lives of people.

I don't really know what you what you are going into with environmental impacts because I've never heard of it being a huge problem. The small impact it might have is offset by the scientic advances that we make including things that can help us with climate change.

The point with National Parks is that we've had to spend a ton of money to develop them so that people can visit them while still protecting them. They aren't places where only the rich can afford to go, but many years ago they weren't all places where everyone could go to. The infrastructure was necessary to make it accessible to more people. Tourism is also vital to the world economy. Trillions of dollars are spent on tourism around the world each year. This is just a different form of it that also just happens to have major scientific benefits as well."

* Dell  
https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6g8fvp/dell_no_longer_accepting_bitcoin_as_payment/
* Edeka  
  Has never accepted Bitcoin as a corporation. There was at some point one franchisee of one store in Hamburg who accepted Bitcoin for his online web shop, but a) not in his physical store (Edeka is a super market chain) and b) stopped accepting Bitcoin even online when it became impractical last year. Today, you can not pay with Bitcoin anywhere in the Edeka organization.
* Alza  
  Is a Czech electronics e-commerce site. Made a [splash about accepting Bitcoin](https://www.alza.cz/bitcoin-everything-you-want-to-know) on their main sites alza.cz and alza.sk early in 2017. Eventually posted an update about high fees and this is what their checkouts look like today: [Alza.cz](https://i.imgur.com/RG2iv3f.png) and [Alza.sk](https://i.imgur.com/4QxlwKl.png). Do you see Bitcoin as a payment option?  
  Besides, [Alza's 2017 revenue was 820m Euros](https://www.alza.cz/history-present-art141.htm), which at the end of 2017 was USD 982m. The exchange rate was highest at the end of the year, so at any time earlier during 2017, it would have been even less in USD. It fails your &gt; $1bn threshold.

Those are some I happen to know about, and I have a feeling they are not the only ones that shouldn't be on your list. T-Mobile, Daimler, Subway etc. - are there really the bn-$ corporate entities behind it or are these stories like with Edeka, where an independent dealer is doing his own thing with payments?

"&gt; And just generally, his heart was in the right place.

***No it fucking wasn't!***

I am so fucking tired of this revisionist history bullshit with Bush II. He was a vile fucking monster. He dropped us into a quagmire in Afghanistan, and then lied to get us into a war in Iraq, both of which are still ongoing messes *15 fucking years later*.

He's a war criminal and has the blood of thousands of US soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Afghanis on his hands. He is directly responsible for the birth of ISIS, the destabilization of an entire region, as well as the anti-Muslim hatred, and racist, nationalistic fervor that is still ripping this country apart. 

Stop trying to normalize him. Stop trying to rewrite history. Stop trying to excuse his enormities. "
"&gt;While overall, the federal government provides only about 9.3 percent of funding for public schools, with the rest pretty much split between state and local sources, this obscures sizable variation across states and localities. 

This is the crux of the problem. 

*Why* are we paying so much in federal taxes when our American children only get 9.3% back for their schools, while the lion's share of the tax burden goes to fund constant military operations that serve no direct benefit to the taxpayers. The boys at Raytheon are laughing all the way to the bank while some schools lay off staff, have dilapidated buildings and overcrowded classrooms.

Meanwhile, state and local governments, which are already stretched thin trying to maintain local sewers and sidewalks, are forced to pick up the tab for education, which should be a fundamental right and funded at the federal level. Many states can't afford the tab, so it's left to the city taxes to fund education, which causes the vast disparity in funding.

The Federal Government needs to put up or shut up. A free and *equal* education is what our federal tax dollars should be supporting. Not endless wars where they use America's children as cannon fodder."

"You have yet to defend Bolton's positions . Bolton advocated toppling Gaddafi and he said Cuba possessed WMDs. Please defend those positions or say that Bolton was wrong for advocating those postions. Right  now ,you're deflecting. 

&gt;please go on about how he was isolationist.

Do you not understand sarcasm? I was sarcastically saying Reagan was an isolationist. You said not doing anythig about marines being killed in Lebanon was weak. Now was Reagan weak , was he an isolationist? He pulled out of Lebanon, was Reagan being weak when he did that? I want to hear an answer on this, as you struggle putting two and two together.


&gt; isolationism has never worked.

I'm not advocating Isolationism. The fact you keep saying that shows you don't know jack shit about foreign policy as Isolationism seems to be the only word you know when describing a country's foreign policy. 

Listen, Isolationism doesn't mean pacifist, it doesn't mean bad. Isolationism refers to a set of foreign policy practices. Your understanding of foreign policy is a joke. Jimmy Carter for example started ""Operation Cyclone"" the program to arm mujaheddin in response to the  Soviet invasion of Afghanistan which Reagan continued . The fact you characterize  Carter as isolationist, that he  wants coexistence with the Soviet Union, shows you don't know anything besides talking points fed to you. Carter was wrong in a lot of respects, but you aren't able to actually criticize Carter in a meaningful way because you think foreign policy is  either ""protect America"" or isolationism. When IR experts criticize Carter they don't say he was an isolationist or pacifist because that is a ignorant statement to make. It would be like saying Trump isn't president, you are making a delusional and pointlessly ignorant statement, as one could say Trump is president and still criticize him.

&gt;war is bad,” opting to attacking Bolton’s character and my intelligence instead.

The  fact you think opposing any war is anti-war shows how childish your understanding of foreign policy is. The proof of burden lies upon you, you support Bolton who has been consistently wrong on foreign policy and you're still not able to defend him. Instead you fall back on empty platitudes.

Thank you. Let's hope someone here already knows the answer and can reply to this. If RTI is the only way then so be it.
"Thanks for clarifying.  Firstly, I need to point out that a lot of the confusion was caused by your use of the word ""rebalancing"".  Rebalancing is a technical term that, in simple terms, refers to the process of bringing one's portfolio back to the % allocations that were originally there.  So if someone had 60% in debt and 40% in equity and because of stock market moving upwards (for example), that ratio became 55% in debt and 45% in equity, then rebalancing is about bringing the portfolio back to the original allocation.  It assumes in the first place that you have a clear view on how much % of your portfolio you plan to keep in each asset class and sub-class.  In a nutshell, the word ""rebalancing"" does not apply in this situation.  

To your question of adding debt- by all means add as much debt to your portfolio as you think you need- but I see no reason to add debt just because your returns are low.  There are good reasons to have a combination of debt and equity in anyone's portfolio: it's just that the proportion between the two would vary from person to person depending on one's financial goals and risk preferences.

For a better understanding of Asset Allocation and Rebalancing, I recommend checking out [this link](https://www.franklintempletonindia.com/investor/distributor-zone/adviser-education/asset-allocation-and-systematic-investing), particularly video no. 2.  It's for advisors but IMO very useful for DIY investors as well."
"Thanks for detailed comments.

War as beneficial is no longer true. With nuclear weapons, it is now too destructive.

Your excellent examples discuss a few great female leaders. However, I find them statistically insignificant. Only when we elect more women can we prove my belief or hypothesis that women are better leaders.

For statistics, look at federal violent crime statistics. Over 90% are men.

Again, I am impressed by your reasoned arguments. Thanks.

"**Rex 84**

Rex 84, short for Readiness Exercise 1984, was a classified scenario and drill developed by the United States federal government to detain large numbers of United States citizens deemed to be ""national security threats"", in the event that the President declared a ""State of National Emergency"". The plan was first revealed in detail in a major daily newspaper by reporter Alfonso Chardy in the July 5, 1987 edition of the Miami Herald. Possible reasons for such a roundup were reported to be widespread opposition to a U.S. military invasion abroad, such as if the United States were to directly invade Central America. To combat what the government perceived as ""subversive activities"", the plan also authorized the military to direct ordered movements of civilian populations at state and regional levels, according to Professor Diana Reynolds.

"For body, I tend to stick with the Garnier Sport and M&amp;S SunSmart, which has a pretty unobjectionable texture.

For facial SPFs, I have a couple of different ones, depending on whether I'm wearing them under makeup (daily wear or outdoor dance performances) or strictly for sport-type purposes (running, hiking, etc). 

For ""strong"" exposure, I use Ultrasun Face SPF 50+, which is very long-wearing, but not especially nice under makeup.  

For daily under-makeup wear, in order of preference:

1. Body Shop Skin Defence SPF 50 -- this is incredibly cosmetically elegant and basically an Asian SPF, but readily available on the high street. My current fave. 

2. Shiseido SENKA Mineral Water UV Gel -- basically the same as the Body Shop but cheaper, with the downside that you have to order it on Amazon from Japan. Great under makeup.  

3. Biore UV Watery Essence -- I don't like the texture of this as much as the two above (they're more ""milky"" and this one is more ""watery"" I guess?) but it's still nice under makeup.

4. Soap &amp; Glory Sunshield Superfluid SPF 50 -- this is also very nice but doesn't feel anything like an Asian sunscreen; it doesn't have silicones so is good if that's a concern for you. 

I may be alone in my loathing for the La Roche-Posay Anthelios line, but I have never been happy with any of their SPFs (and I've tried, I think, five!). They're not good under makeup and often have a white cast, and I've had one or two that pill up even on *bare skin*!

Additionally, my original comment wasn't about who is accountable.

That's the wiki definition. I think like 'killing spree' and 'mass murder' the definition probably isn't set entirely in stone. However, I would say that 'incident' makes it sound like something that happens very quickly, either a natural disasters or shooting that occurs in less than I dunno an hour total time and therefore is over before police can intervene.

This was SEVEN hours. There was time to do something or at least it feels that way. Maybe it would be more appropriate to call it a 'mass casualty event'. It is semantics, definitely, it just depends on whether the word incident makes it seem like they are trying to bury how negligently they acted for people who never read beyond the headline."

"&gt;an adult watching with a shotgun is very different than just an adult. Make up your mind. 

You may have misread my original post. I never said anything about an adult with a shotgun. I said an adult should be watching for kids wlaking in with a shotgun (or any other gun). These are huge guns, not pistols that can be hid in a pocket. Anyone just keeping an eye on whose walking in the school with a big bag would be enough to give everyone inside an early warning. 

I agree with everything else you said, and obviously having an early warning that a guy with a gun is approaching the school is not a solution that would stop people from trying to commit mass murder, but it is a very simple and straightforward step that would reduce the casualties from these incidents until the other steps are taken to address the actual issue.

"&gt;The deaths represent the worst mass shooting in Australia since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania. That event was the catalyst for a significant strengthening of the country’s gun laws.

&gt;American proponents of gun control, including former President Barack Obama, often point to Australia’s strict regulations and few mass shootings as a guide to limiting such events in the United States. Experts typically define a mass shooting as the deaths of four people, excluding the gunman, in a single event.

Yet they conveniently fail to mention all the other massacres that have happened since then (mostly arson, but those don't count because reasons).

Also, someone has already updated the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Australia), people are the worst.

"""Just buy low"" - sage advice."
Most people who Google Bitcoin end up on Bitcoin.Com
Doge at least is not a scam. The creator was always honest about it being a joke. 
"In fairness, a couple of points need to be corrected there.

The *Mt Gox is totally fine* video was not talking about BTC solvency. He was addressing the banking issues, that the community was concerned about at the time. At the time that video was made, nobody even dreamed that they were insolvent with regards to the amount of BTC they had. That all came out 7 months later. Watch [Kim Nilssons presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l70iRcSxqzo), note the dates the hacks occurred, the dates they were discovered, and note the date Roger made that video. You can also search this very subreddit and read the threads about the video and about MtGox to see for yourself how that all actually went down. Framing the video years later as something that was released just before Gox went down is either ill-informed - or just plain dishonest.

Secondly, if you're going to say that making a personal decision to refer to something as a different name is fraudulent, then you better make sure you are not doing the same thing yourself. If we are truly concerned about newcomers to the space getting the right info, then it applies equally to both sides. If you strongly believe that referring to BCH as Bitcoin is wrong, then it stands to reason that referring to it as bcash is equally wrong. You can't reasonably demand somebody to use a correct name, when you aren't doing it yourself.

"Mueller is investigating collusion, correct? And as Cohen's case has not yet been directly linked to the collusion investigation, Mueller deferred his case to the FBI, right? If this is the case, why are we asking what this case has to do with collusion? Cohen is being investigated for bank fraud, a crime which he is on record as committing for two of the three clients that he has worked with in the past year. 

Your initial question,
&gt;Why do we and the judge care?

can be answered without discussing collusion."
"&gt;Populists Leaders Push 

&gt;Nationally known populist leaders also pushed FDR to the left for a while.  Huey Long is best know for his “Share the Wealth” program.  He proposed to cap personal wealth and personal income and inheritance for the rich. Long proposed a guaranteed income, thirty hour work week, four week vacation, old age pension, free college or vocational training.  As Governor of Louisiana and then US Senator he used the resources of the state to build hospitals, schools and roads.  An estimated 20 Million listened to his radio broadcasts and he received 60,000 pieces of mail a week as a US Senator. Long tried to form an independent party to challenge the Democrats.

&gt;Robert Townsend was a doctor from California that proposed an old age pension. It generated extraordinary nationwide support and was part of the reason we have Social Security today. There were over 7,000 “Townsend Clubs” with over 2.2 million members and they called for the nationalization of banks. In 1936 Townsend was able to deliver petitions to Congress containing 10 million hard copy signatures in support of the Townsend Plan.

&gt;And when judging the movements of the 30’s, remember that the US population was only 130 million or so, less than a third of current levels.

Snip

&gt;Legislators on the Left

&gt;The grassroots rebellion reached into the halls of Congress. In the mid-term election of 1934 the Democrats won a super-majority, but much more important — at least 35 Democrats stood to FDR’s left.  Pressure groups like the Washington Commonwealth Federationworked to elect progressive Democrats. Third parties helped push the New Deal as well.

&gt;+ The 73rd congress elected in 1932 had five members of Congress from the Farmer-Labor party, 313 Democrats, 117 Republicans.

&gt;+ The 74th Congress elected in 1934 had seven members from the newly founded Progressive Party (Wisconsin), three from the Farmer-Labor, 322 Democrats and 103 Republicans.

&gt;+ The 75th congress elected in 1936 had eight members from the Progressive Party, five from the Farmer Labor, 334 Democrats and 88 Republicans. Two senators were outside the major parties: Robert La Follette from the Wisconsin Progressive Party and George Norris a progressive Republican from Nebraska that left the party to run as an independent.

&gt;Here are the facts: as the number Democrats grew, the number of radical Democrats grew and the number of the third parties representatives grew. At the same time socialist and communist parties were polling about 5% combined. All progressives grew at the same time! What happened to the spoiler? The lesser of two evils? Those arguments did not yet exist and only exist now to frighten and control the weak minded.

&gt;Imagine Bernie Sanders as president with 35 Democrats in the House to his left and 13 Green Party congress members to their left with significant electoral campaigns by self-styled revolutionary parties.  And all in the context of a vast of popular rebellion — that might be what another New Deal would look like.

&gt;***In periods of dramatic change old categories are transformed or reconstructed. Before the New Deal, the Democrats had been the conservative party — during the New Deal they became the more progressive party.***  The Republicans — the last successful revolutionary party, the last third party to become a major party — became the more conservative party. Mass political upheaval, third parties and revolutionary organizations fueled the flames of political change."
"State-by-state crib notes from the article:

* Michigan officials determined last month that activists collected enough signatures to place a marijuana legalization measure on the general election ballot. Unless state lawmakers decide to enact legalization themselves in the next few weeks, voters will see the cannabis question when they go to the polls in November. Recent MSU polls found 61% favor legalization, with 34 percent opposing legalization and only five percent remaining undecided.

* Oklahoma voters will consider a measure on the June 26 primary ballot to allow medical cannabis. A January poll found that 62% of likely voters support the proposal, while only 31% are opposed.

* Utah, county officials determined last month that activists collected enough signatures to qualify a medical marijuana measure for the November ballot. A March survey showed that 77% of Utah adults support legalizing medical cannabis. 
 Opponents led by the Utah Medical Association and a local task force of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration are currently trying to kick the measure off the ballot by convincing voters who signed petitions to remove their signatures.

* Missouri, competing campaigns filed signatures in support of three separate medical cannabis ballot measures this month. State officials will now count the signatures to determine which, if any, will qualify to go before voters in November. In any case, while there haven't been recent public surveys on the issue, previous state polling shows that voters would be poised to approve a marijuana measure.  A July 2016 survey, for example, found that 62% of Missouri voters supported an earlier potential medical cannabis ballot question, with just 27% against."

"Global will have an embargo over Ipsos's numbers until tomorrow morning, but we can stitch the regionals together from Global's puzzle-like reporting:

* 905: PC 49, NDP 29, OLP 20
* 416: NDP 38, PC 34, OLP 26
* Southwest: NDP 41, PC 35, OLP 18
* North: NDP 47, PC 27, OLP 25
* Central: PC 41, NDP 39, OLP 20
* East: PC 49, OLP 26, NDP 18

(Global has conflicting numbers regarding the Northern and SW regions; I suspect that these above are the accurate numbers and that the map in the article is wrong).

As a New Democrat, I salivate at that 416 number and that amazing SWO number, and I scratch my head in wonder at the NDP being two points behind in Central Ontario.

But if I were a Conservative, I'd still take a lot of comfort in the PCs' huge leads in the 905 and the East. I think the NDP still has room to grow and that there will be polls soon showing them ahead of the PCs - but unless they make real serious headway in those regions, the election will still be the PCs' to lose.

(Too Close to Call's simulator gives PC 69, NDP 50, OLP 5, though it doesn't have any kind of regional coefficient, and that matters.)"

"I think it dramatically oversimplifies what judges do, because umpires use a code -- a series of rules designed to cover every situation. In our legal system, there are tons of examples of cases in which the law is either unclear or simply silent, and so the judge is left to figure out what the best answer is (something we don't usually leave to umpires).

Here's an example: The Supreme Court has ""original"" jurisdiction of disputes between two or more states. So when neighboring states have a border dispute, only the Supreme Court can resolve it. But what law should apply in such cases? Congress hasn't exactly passed a body of federal law to govern state borders, and each state has a vested interest in their own law deciding the matter.

The Supreme Court's answer to this problem, historically, has been to say ""it's clear in this circumstance that we, the Justices, should fashion a common law rule to govern the dispute."" I think that's right, and I think that's not remotely close to what umpires do. And for that example, there are thousands more... "

. Water wash AM and PM or oil cleanse only if I wore sunscreen. But I realised this was making my skin sting more so I had cut out sunblock as well, I stayed out of the sun as well though.

. The Origins Mega Mushroom Relief Lotion 3 layers Super HGGGGG!!

. Klairs Midnight Blue Calming Cream HG!!!!

. Primera soothing sensitive cream - couldn't really tell what this did for me I'm going back to my Klairs soothing cream

I got a bit lazy with washing my face with water for two nights a row this week so I started breaking out (but it looked more like miniscule whiteheads than acne) so I had to get a cleanser!!

So as off this week 

. Clinique take the day off oil cleanser - PM only

. Clinique Redness Solutions Cleanser (not AB but Clinique is life lol) I have been using their anti blemish cleanser for years but it's too harsh to use at the moment. Anyways my thoughts are that it's very moisturising, definitely non stripping at all as it has a rich cream like texture. The sales advisor also said that it has a very gentle exfoliant built in so it would take care of clogs in a very gentle way. I have been using it twice a day for the past few days but I will be dropping it back down to once a day once the whiteheads have completely gone as I suffer from redness.

"The full publications from the ONS have more detail:

&gt; Construction output was estimated to have decreased by 3.3% in Quarter 1 2018, contributing negatively to GDP by 0.21 percentage points; this was the weakest quarterly construction growth since Quarter 2 (Apr to June) 2012. The large fall in construction growth in Quarter 1 2018 follows strong growth in December 2017, as seen in the Construction output in Great Britain: December 2017 bulletin. **There is some evidence of an impact of the bad weather on construction output. However, output fell across all three months of the quarter, not just during the period of bad weather.**

&gt; While there was some evidence that the recent adverse weather conditions had a dampening impact on construction activity in both February and March 2018, **the weakness in Quarter 1 2018 is due largely to a sharp fall in output in January 2018 – prior to the snow**. The latest published monthly path for construction shows that output fell by 3.1% in January 2018, the largest monthly fall since April 2012. This was due mainly to an 8.3% fall in private new housing, following a historically high level of output in December 2017. Despite this monthly fall in January 2018, private new housing recorded its eighth consecutive month of three-monthly growth in February 2018 and remains the bright spot in the construction sector.

Fun paragraph:

&gt; The Toronto-area businessman was convicted of fraud in two different jurisdictions during a single month of 2011, one prosecution netting him a 41-day jail term. Among his crimes, Dhillon passed himself off as a credit counselor, then siphoned $10,000 from his clients’ accounts using their own debit cards and ATMs. Regulatory agencies have twice fined him for acting as a real estate or mortgage broker without a licence, and have warned the public to steer clear of his business.

Syria and Russia are not seen as friendly states, nor are they seen as that useful.  It all comes to together to make a more compelling case for action.

"It's a thing that goes in the sky. One of them only goes so high and the other one went to the moon. That's all he means by ""more sophisticated"". Yes they're different technologies, but absolutely everyone knows that. You're being stupidly pedantic. "
"If you pointed a radio telescope at Sol from anywhere up to about 60 light years away, Sol would stand out from the average nearby stars because something close to Sol is broadcasting a lot of electromagnetic energy on a lot of odd frequencies not associated with normal stellar phenomena. That's us. Earth radiates radio frequency energy across a fairly wide spectrum and has done so since the 1920s. After WWII, the amount we broadcast became literally astronomical. We would look a little bit like a star to a distant radio telescope.

The inverse square law means that the further you get from Earth the harder it would be to hear us. We really don't know what the practical distance is for listening to a 20th/21st century civilization, but it's probably relatively short in interstellar terms.

It doesn't matter if that data is encrypted or not. The sheer weirdness of the broadcast will be the signal that it's not natural. Even if we can't figure out the content, finding enormous radio emissions that would be generated from our kind of civilization would be unmistakable.

We've listened to all the nearby stars and we don't hear anything. So there's probably nothing like our tech nearby.

But there are a few frequencies that might serve as long-distance options. The frequency that hydrogen absorbs radio waves at is very quiet, in a galactic context, because stars (which generate most electromagnetic emissions) are full of hydrogen. If you wanted to send a loud ""HELLO! IS ANYONE OUT THERE?"" signal, you would broadcast it on that frequency. With the amount of background noise reduced, such a signal might be heard at galactic distances.

We (people of Earth) have done that a couple of times. But we don't have a continuous broadcast going and there are good reasons to not do that. Why let a few enthusiasts make the decision on risking attracting the attention of hostile aliens? It's bad policy (even if it's practically unstoppable if someone really wanted to do it). We do listen on that frequency though. And so far, we've never heard anything.

Anyone broadcasting such a message wouldn't encrypt it. They'd make it as plain as possible to determine it was not random noise."

Technically speaking you're right - private donors aren't required to support any university in particular or not. That's their choice. But the donors are the ones who made this an attempt to stifle speech they didn't like. 

The explicit threat to withdraw funding *based on inviting a particular figure to speak* is unquestionably an attempt to silence that figure. You can agree they have the right to do that, but you can't deny the intent behind their actions. 

It also begs the question of what they thought they were buying with their money, since apparently they felt it meant an unspoken agreement that the University would self-censor about any opinions that might be detrimental to its donors interests. "

"The economy was slowing long before the EU referendum, and that's the fault of the Tory government and the discredited neo-liberal ideology they cling to. 

I think part of the reason the remainers lost the referendum is because their entire argument was basically a form of blackmail - ""vote for the EU or the sky will fall down"" well I accept that it will damage profits for business, but I don't think it'll be the cataclysm that Osborne and Cameron predicted, I think they went into the realm of hyperbole and bullying and whilst it won't help the economy, it won't be the End of Days like some are suggesting, especially if we persue a soft brexit and make sure that we get the Tories out at the first opportunity.

Britain's economic woes long predate the EU referendum and are linked to austerity and Tory government. The EU is not a bulwark against neo-liberalism and hasn't really been effective prior to the referendum in stopping the Tories (and their Lib Dem accomplices before them) tearing apart the fabric of the community in the way they have.

And most importantly democracy in the UK will become a meaningless sham if the results of referenda such as this are rejected because big business says so. The people are sovereign, not the FTSE 100.

"Even though the article is two months old, it's got some good points in it. But for a better update on what is new in the case, read Moon of Alabamas coverage of Craig Murrays.

The Skripals were probably poisoned with fentanyl, not nerve agent and the cop who was also poisoned might have been his handler. The reason why they were poisoned might have been because he wanted to talk about the Steele dossier and tell people how fake it was. The people who paid for the dossier didn't want the truth to come out. Bye, bye Skripals. 

The Skripals were never photographed at the hospital nor has anyone interviewed the cop who was poisoned. They have all disappeared and Russian authorities have not been able to speak to them. "
"Your comment greatly confuses me since it seems you didn't read what you quoted (or not the thread itself), but here it goes:

Define step(z) = 1{z &gt; 0}, f(x,w) = step(x.w) and loss(x,w) = (1/2) * (f(x,w) - y)^2. Set fake gradients dstep/dz = 1.

Then dloss/dw = (f(x) - y) * x

Gradient descent with learning rate 1 would give you:

w_{t+1} = w_t - dloss/dw = w_t  - (f(x) - y) * x = w_t + (y - f(x)) * x

Which is the same as the Perceptron update. If you read carefully you'll see a mention of fake gradients for the sign function, so it doesn't matter if it's differentiable or not."

I think your actually have a point. The possibility of the British government being involved into such a conspiracy should seem less plausible for a citizen of such a country. What your opponent is trying to say it's that you shouldn't base your assumptions on the previous behaviour of the person/government in question. 

To be strict, you shouldn't assume anything at all and try to keep your head cool. Look at the facts, base your assumptions exclusively on the facts at hand. Russia is being denied any involvement into the case of poisoning the Skripal and his daughter, who is a Russian citizen. This is not having respect for your own laws - it is merely applying the law when it suits your agenda. I don't think this is either lawful or deserving confidence and trust in the British government."

"My first pan post!
I’ve had the pro contour mini palette a while and LOVED the highlighters, however the contour was slightly too deep for me in winter. So I went on and bought the hamptons weekend palette shortly after it’s release, as I often do my makeup on the go, this had everything I would ever need! I wasn’t a big fan of the blush, it’s nothing like their clay formulas. I liked the contour though which indeed was lighter and suited me well, and the highlight (beach getaway) was a good addition and more natural looking. I dropped my palette once and a pan flew out (didn’t break!!) and I realised that hamptons weekend palette is actually magnetic! I quickly depotted my pro contour palette, popped the two highligts in here instead (Gleam silver &amp; Burst gold) and been absolutely loving it since! Burst is my favourite highlight ever, will be sad to see it go. In the future I’ll pop the contours back in, but I am panning a contour stick atm so don’t really need it just yet. Til then, I’ll keep on shining and loving this palette! ♥️"

"&gt; Conservatives' argument for passing a law now is that by the time it reaches the U.S. Supreme Court — which could take three or four years — Trump could potentially have appointed another one or two justices who could bolster Gorsuch and overturn Roe.

All it takes is a circuit split on these types of laws and they're before the US Supreme Court.

A lot of people don't understand this is a long term game plan they have, they have been playing angles since Roe came down. Too many cynically think this is some sort of wedge issue that the GOP will magically find a way to not resolve, forgetting that should they succeed they will stand atop the mountain of their success and cry about the pro-choicers coming to make killing babies legal again which should be just as effective.

As an aside one thing that aggravates me is the standard of whether a fetus can survive on its own outside the uterus as being the cut-off (which is one thing these people try to push). As technology advances it is inevitable that with the next probably 50 years we will be able to grow test tube humans so viability will be as soon as conceived. We need not only a Supreme Court that upholds Roe, we need one that has better standards that don't lend themselves to shifting the goal-posts for various reasons. Bodily autonomy certainly comes to mind."

Here's what I get from these articles. There are occasional killings of self-professed atheists in Bangladesh. Obviously that's fucked up. Also, in times of crisis, the government has arrested atheist bloggers only to release them when it couldn't actually press any charges against them according to its legal system.  

Detaining bloggers is fucked up. But the outcome of this suggests to me the opposite of the claims I've been arguing against above: namely, that Muslim governments are either putting apostates to death or (as you suggested) letting non-state actors do so. It seems to me that there's a much messier picture here, in part involving some government actors doing shitty things (like detaining people or victim blaming) but then not being able to carry through with these things precisely *because* of existing legal protections, i.e., because of protections put in place by the state.

"Reading the commentary it seems that would be a misrepresentation. 

There are queries as to why its labelled a racist attack as a standalone question, as some do not associate use of Spanish with an ethnicity or race. Given that Global Languages such as English and Spanish are often spoken by a great deal of ethnicities and races, and are not necessarily inherent, their point is understandable. Ironically, the replies addressing this initially showed more prejudice by implying this wasn't the case (I.e. what's more prejudicial... Saying all Iberians speak Spanish or Not all Spanish speakers are Iberian). 

Of course. It may well have been a racially motivated attack, but other than the police treating the case as such, all we have to go on is the actions of the perpetrators. All we know there is their problem with Spanish being spoken. We don't know whether they took umbridge with this because they were from a certain race, or just the use of the language itself. And ultimately we cannot know such things. 

What is most disappointing is Redditors were talked down for asking a question they appeared to honestly wish to cordially (initially) discuss. This reflects badly on the level of discourse available. Should racism have actually be present in the mind of the query'er, then shouting them down and abusing them would be less than helpful in showing them their error. "

"Labour constituencies are mostly Leave but that's because the *non*-Labour voters living in such constituencies overwhelmingly voted to Leave. Labour voters still mostly opted for Remain (65%) whereas Conservative voters were only 40% Remain.

So basically, no, on balance Labour voters don't want Brexit.  "
"Similar income and situation as you not too long ago, but numbers were much lower for ""Personal &amp; Medical"", ""Car loan/Transport &amp; auto"" and ""Entertaimment &amp; Eating out"". We try to keep overseas travel to every 2nd year, which is our splurge. Car loan is non existent. Eating out/entertainment could be better as we spend close to $100/week there. 

Other items that could improve are;

* Mobile phone: unless this is a valid work deduction, just seems a tad high. Easily knock 40% off there

* Food/groceries - give Aldi a go. We're lucky to spend $100/week there for two adults

* Transport &amp; auto - your total vehicles/travelling expenses are close to $20K each year. I know it isn't cheap but this is very high

Overall, you should be fine and can mostly continue your lifestyle, but it doesn't leave a hell of a lot if you ever want to retire early. Being frugal in some areas will save you a fair chunk of money without a major impact, but others you'd need to have a good discussion with your partner. "

"Comment:

&gt;There will be great temptation to escalate on the Russian side too. Karlin set this out yesterday in his cheerily entitled piece in Unz; 'The Road to World War III'. In essence his point is the same as Putin's; that cornering a rat (the weaker opponent) will require the rat to use everything at its disposal to retaliate - or face oblivion. It has a deeply fatalistic tone and he includes an upbeat assessment of the survivability of an all out nuclear exchange, for those lucky enough to live in ""rural areas"" (he lives in Moscow). He ends by saying that we probably deserve it ""..because getting manipulated into rage quitting on your own civilization by some Middle Eastern tribes is really, really retarded, and stupidity needs to be punished.""."

&gt; The gas sales to Mexico are an important source of revenue for American oil and pipeline companies, and they relieve a bulge of gas that is bubbling up with oil from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the nation&amp;#039;s most prolific shale field.

&gt; Before the boom in shale oil production, refineries along the Gulf of Mexico were designed to process heavy oil grades from Canada, Mexico and Venezuela.

The implications of voiding the Iran nuclear deal:
&gt;
Since Mr. Trump has torn up the Iran nuclear deal, any conceivable Iranian government, not just the current one, would have to be not only stupid but suicidal not to try to protect itself.
&gt;
What that means, in stark terms, is that it is likely to pay any price to avoid the mistakes of Saddam Husain and Muamar Qaddafi. They either did not have (Saddam) or gave up (Qaddafi) nuclear weapons.
&gt;
We taught them two lessons:  first, not to have the means to defend themselves (which in our times equates to nuclear weapons) and, second, to trust us to let them live, is fatal.
&gt;
My experience with the leaders of a number of nations convinces me that they are usually rather sensitive to the danger of being overthrown or murdered.
&gt;
I am terrified that identified or predictable other states will decide on these bases to acquire nuclear weapons.  I shudder to think of a world of even more nuclear-weapons states.
&gt; 
We have survived with  9 countries' leaders, some of whom I would not trust with a pistol, having control of a nuclear weapon or hundreds of them.
&gt;
So far, they have  decided not to attack either one another or someone else.  Albert Wohlstetter, the ""big bomb"" man engaged as a propagandist by the US Air Force, against whom I often debated at the University of Chicago,  called this the ""delicate balance of terror.""
&gt;
 I call it dumb luck.
&gt;
What we are now living under is frightening enough — that well-informed nuclear weapons practitioner former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara called it ""bizarre.""  As he wrote, """"The whole situation seems so bizarre as to be beyond belief. On any given day, as we go about our business, the president is prepared to make a decision within 20 minutes that could launch one of the most devastating weapons in the world...that is what we have lived with for 40 years. With very few changes, this system remains largely intact..."""

"Think the issue here is keeping him alive will mean different machines keeping him alive if/when his brain deteriorates more. So far so much of his brain has been replaced by fluids. From what i've heard from people in the profession having tubes feeding him or helping his organs function isn't easy and has risk of infections and further problems. This isn't keeping him living like an kid in an iron lung, there's pretty much no chance of recovery or awareness of life. It sounds like he will either die from further deterioration, problems with living so long on a support system, or dying through a process of palliative care. The guardians/his parents won't know the in and outs of this process to keep him alive or the impact all this will have on his body. They don't seem to see this as a terminal illness that's at the end and are calling it a misdiagnosis. This won't help their son or themselves from grief. Plus the parents don't want the doctors to act as guardians which is why it went to a judge to weigh up all the sides. I admit it is tricky situation and a hard one for hospitals and the legal system, the family to deal with. Ideally the person should decide themselves but in sudden accident so with children this cannot always be possible.

"Yes we have a special deal and some customers want to alter it and still get the deal price. I tell them no and if they argue about it then I still tell them no. 

There is also a lady who complains about the price almost every time she comes in “well, it was less than that last time”. “This doesn’t feel as full as it should be”. That sort of stuff. And if everything is 100% the way she thinks it should be then  she wants “to speak to a manager” AKA me.  It’s gotten bad enough that my employees refuse to help her and I dont let my new employees help her either.  Problem is she spends hundreds of dollars throughout the year with us and I can’t just turn that down.

We cleaned up the vomit, then she came back to the register and demanded her money back because she was “not in the mood any more”.

"It really depends on what you want to do. If you're tired of the project and you want to experiment with other stuff, a cash influx of 15 million is nothing to sneeze at and would allow you the liberty of experimenting with whatever you want. If you have a plan on how to grow the idea even more then you can do so just on the profits from that particular project, so there is no point in selling. 

The main risk is that your potential buyer is trying to remove the competition before entering the space, and so you need to ask yourself how much you rely on the network effect. If you rely heavily on the network effect, then the barrier of entry for a new competitor is higher and they need to build something from scratch, attract more users than you, and then have a hope of competing/siphoning your users away. If you don't rely on the network effect, then it's just a matter of outspending you and they are trying to do you a favor and speed up the process by buying you out and taking your userbase.

There's never reference to the global market or actual step-by-step plans for deregulation that avoid us ending up with protesting farmers blasting the centre block with shit tankers every 5 years. NZ's regulations exist to protect consumers against a private monopoly (currently &gt;85%ish of their marketshare). America's national co-op is corrupt as anything, and the industry went as far as lottery-based herd slaughter to rapidly reduce supply (oh, and CWT is also corrupt and settled lawsuit from its own farmers for $50M). Not to mention the abusive treatment of contract farmers. The EU deregulated and then sanctioned a major milk importer for a multiplicative effect on supply. The Netherlands then put a tradeable quota on phosphate effluent effectively capping herd sizes without the tariff side of things that makes supply restriction possible. Australian farmers recently got backstabbed by a processor who cut its milk price, then retroactively clawed back 10 months of milk payments due to the ""overpayment"". Then there's the mental health crisis in the Northeast US and Oz. 

I'll get behind ending supply management when there is a proposal that codifies the protection of a farmer's right to speak out against a buyer, that forces companies to respect their contracts and prohibits tournament contracting, that shields consumers against consolidation of processors, and that doesn't burden non-dairy consuming Canadians with the bill for subsidies.

Two, ""they"" is not a study. When measuring total economic impact, domestic oems still fair well, especially with large vehicles. Honda and Toyota are equally good for things that they mostly engineer stateside like trucks and Minivans aka Ridgeline, tundra, Odyssey, pilot, Sequoia. Hyundai and Kia do not.

"$28k a year is ~$2333 a month. But, let's say she buys a $200k house with some of that money before the safe withdrawal. Now she's looking at $500k, which returns $20k a year at 4% withdrawal, or ~$1666 a month. 

So, $1666 a month, no mortgage, no car payment (because for ~20k of the principle a reasonable car can be purchased brand new or gently used with barely any miles on it, that'll last 20+ years. Say a 3-to-5-year-old Subaru, around $11-20k, and that's assuming the car isn't paid off already which it could be with smart finances.) $1666 a month ($1600 with the car at $20k) *would be* poverty level, if it was for someone trying to make ends meet with no assets to their name; it'd also be poverty level living if living in a high COL area. 

However, with a paid off house, paid off car... they've got what, taxes (property, at least), insurance, utilities, internet, phone and groceries as basic expenses? Figure they eat well, budget $500 a month in groceries... that's about what I spent at a high point of dining out on the regular and feeding calories a body that was working out to meet US Armed Forces physical standards. Insurance for the paid off car and house together ought to run less than $150 a month for top coverage, we'll call it $200 in case they like to speed or park illegally a lot, or just don't shop around at all. Annual taxes of about $2000 are reasonable on a $200k property most places - this is my line of work, it could go higher or lower but that's a fair number to estimate. $2000 a year is $166 a month; call it another $200 a month just to be safe. Utilities for a house heated all winter and cooled all summer... $100 a month for a small house, $200 or so for a large one: call it another $200, but note this is also very conservative and those numbers could easily go down like everything else in this section. Internet: we'll go for top-tier residential prices in an expensive area, and call it $100 a month. Phone, we'll assume they just want easy coverage from a large carrier and call it another $100 a month. Again, with careful shopping around both the phone and internet could be cut in half, but the majority of people who don't want to fuss will be paying the prices listed or lower.

Alright, we have a budget: Property insurance: $200, Groceries: $500, Taxes: $200, Utilities: $200, Internet: $100, Phone: $100, Mortgage: $0, Car: $0. Oh, Gas! Call it $100, conservatively. Total: $1400 a month. 

This leaves $200 a month to play around with. It is totally play money: savings aren't needed as the nest egg is already in the bank paying for all of this. $200 a month isn't a ton, but it's not nothing. Importantly: that's what's left after pretty significant excesses in all aspects of major expenses in the person's life. Every number we estimated could be cut in half without much difficulty with a very small amount of effort, resulting in $900 a month left over for play money, and virtually all the same services and luxuries available. $900 a month to party with is far from poverty. Hell, most of the impoverished I know would be ecstatic to be able to find $200 a month to put towards anything they like. 

Now, most of those figures are accounting for one person. Groceries are the main thing that goes up if you're accounting for more than one person. So, for comparison we should look at actual poverty. [The US poverty level is considered to be $12,140 for a single person in 2018.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States). For a family of four, that roughly doubles to $25,100, although this usually assumes that family of four still needs to do things like pay rent and pay for transportation. To be fair, for more than two people, a second car probably would be required. The closest number on the chart for 2018 poverty to our $1600 a month figure is actually a family of 3. So, three people living off $1600 a month would be below the federal poverty line this year.

Then you have to realize that people living at the poverty level are doing a few things for that income that our $700k in the bank is not. They are: working to earn their wages, or receiving government assistance for some reason. The most common forms of welfare in the US are Social Security, State Healthcare, and Food Stamps in that order. Generally speaking, it's safe to assume that those who are on social security and/or receiving disability benefits aren't in a good shape to be working, and many employers don't hire elderly or the infirm due to business risks. 

Our $500k in the bank + house are unique in that they generating that $1600/mo without any work being done by the owner. The house sits on $200k in equity, which may (and likely will) grow over the long term, which is almost like having $200k in the bank earning interest. The owner can still work. If they're disabled, they likely still qualify for the same government assistance programs that other disabled folks do. If they're old enough, they still qualify for social security, as long as that program continues. If they're able to work, they can still earn a wage -- working whatever hours they choose and for whatever wage they're willing to accept, because they have the freedom of choice which comes from knowing no matter what they choose to do, their expenses are covered.

One last thing to note here is that the safe withdrawal of 4% implies that the capital will grow as fast or faster than you're drawing it down, which means after all this, they're still left with $700k to play with. If they *are* old enough, say in their 60s or 70s, it may not be worth saving all that capital. If they *double* their safe withdrawal rate (which is likely still safe, given that SWR is calculated to ensure no loss of capital and is usually overly conservative by most statistical data gathered,) they're spending $40k a year and won't run out of capital for around 20 years. Even if they aren't old, $700k is the kind of money that buys out existing, profitable businesses. Pays franchise costs and renovation fees for multiple storefronts, which - with enough staff on hand - can be entirely hands off for the owner. It buys property and hires a very expensive, very skilled management company. Any of these options can generate revenues far exceeding that $1600 a month.

TL;DR: from a guy whose entire life, career and business are built around investing and personal finance, $1.2M, or ~$700k after taxes, allows for a lifestyle which is far from poverty."

single use bags

- A substantial shift to more durable bags would deliver environmental gains through reductions in greenhouse gases, energy and water use, resource depletion and litter.

- The reusable, non-woven plastic (polypropylene) ‘Green Bag’ was found to achieve the greatest environmental benefits

- The shift from one single use bag to another single use bag may improve one environmental outcome, but be offset by another environmental impact. As a result, no single use bag produced an overall environmental benefit.

- Recycled content in bags generally led to lowering the overall environmental impact of bags

- The end of life destination is crucial, with greater environmental savings achieved from recycling all bags at the end of their useful life"

Im gonna have to disagree with ya there. Im non-religious now, but I did have to endure 12 *fucking* years of parochial education.

I think theres like a 3 point(?) difference on the ACT, which is a huge margin. 

Im not trying to correlate this to the religious classes they take, more to the level of coursework required in general. When I got to college, I realized I had already taken most of the pre-req classes; I only attended 4 of my 10 classes my freshman year because I was able to complete all my courses just using the syllabus and some math to make sure I still got the grades. 

Also, I have to say that I did experience a healthy combination of acceptance I think. Probably my favorite class from high school was World Religions my senior year.

&gt;And great logic too, ""It's only a problem when it is.""

It's not a problem, but many things become a 'problem' when you lower the bar enough in what we expect the bare minimum of understanding. It's problem if you find that:

1) It's OK someone owns a car but has no idea how basic functions work

2) It's OK they have no responsibility to read the user manual which would state those functions

3) It's the car maker's fault the car doesn't have features the user literally makes up and the car is never stated to have

4) After doing all of the above they don't turn off the car even though literally every other driving experience they have had in their life says they should

5) They do all of the above in an enclosed space

6) They do all of the above and have zero functional carbon monoxide detectors in their house

And all of the above also needs to be done by someone supposedly qualified enough to have a driver's license.

To act as though it's not is foolish in the extreme, so I guess my primary argument is with the elimination of established jobs.  Yes it would happen, no I don't think it's enough to justify  non-livable wages.  Yes it would be awful for those whose jobs were eliminated, but that's going to happen sooner or later anyhow.  Better to ensure that anyone who IS working is entitled to survive off that wage and that anyone who's ejected from their positions due to automation or closure is caught by social safety nets.

Again it doesn't discuss paying individual voters but funneling money to political bases (farmers or whatever) through subsidies etc. 

To my mind though, the above guy above/below is right that this wouldn't benefit anyone, least of all political campaigns. Assuming that voters would vote with the highest bidder, the cost of the vote would likely just increase exponentially, becoming nonviable quite quickly. Plus there's the risk of incentivizing swing voting, eroding one's own base. Also, in really vague terms, I don't think the argument that 'it happens anyway' is good enough justification for formalizing the process rather than challenging it.

"Wrong, wrong and wrong. Sorry. I have had to deal with IEP's and 504's. You have to prove you have a disability that qualifies under IDEA for an IEP which provides services, but also includes accommodations. 504's are accomodation only, but you still have to prove a disability to obtain one. 
It doesn't matter if driving or parking is a privilege, the point is accessing that accomodation requires a proof of disability, which makes it no different. 
And yes, you do have to fill out a form at many apartment complexes and have a doctor sign off that your animal is for your specific need. I worked a case where a disabled tenant was required to do so and it was completely legal. So try again. 
Have you ever seen a disabled person with a service animal be attacked by another ""service animal"" and the whole time that disabled person is saying, ""no it's ok, they need their dog too""? No? Never had to have your heart break by watching someone who actually has a need be abused by someone abusing a system designed for them? Didn't think so. Maybe what you need to do is take a step back and realize that not everyone is out to attack persons with disabilities and is actually trying to find a way to ensure that they have access to the things they need. But I guess jumping to conclusions and name calling is just so much easier. "

"MAD relies on the ironic assumption that neither side *wants* to use nuclear weapons, but *will* use nuclear weapons if they have to to defend themselves.

MAD and Chinese backing is what has kept the North from being toppled by any sane goverment inclined to intervene. Suddenly however there is someone who is not only very much more unstable than any previous NK dictator in a position of power and inclined to use nuclear weapons with or possibly without provocation.

I would argue that the inherent fear of a rambling orange senile clown holding their finger over the button as a crowd screams ""press it press it"" where the button in this instance, decides whether your country exists three minutes later...is something worth being actually afraid of right now.

More than likely the Chinese encouraged the NK leadership to start descalating for at least the next few years while Trump is in office, but there is a very real chance he could go off the deep end\(let's be honest here, he has all the signs of someone going through early stage dementia\)."

"Frankly speaking, finance + econ will just be a lot of wasted time and energy on redundant coursework. You get a good chunk of econ in finance, and you get a good chunk of finance in econ. If that's really want you want, double check that you will meet the credit requirements for both majors, because a class that is shared between two majors may not be credited to both. If it's a major + minor, it'd work, but only do this if you're genuinely interested in econ and not with the expectation that it will be a huge career boost.

The problem with taking an MIS minor is it's not very useful for a career. You won't really need it for finance, and you won't be able to get an MIS job with just a minor. I'd really only consider it a kicker if you plan on getting an MBA down the line.

On that note, consider splitting it up into undergraduate and graduate. There are a lot of grad schools out there that offer one-year finance programs, and you will learn a hell of a lot more in those than you will in undergrad. Generally, graduate finance does not really touch on econ much, so there is less overlap. Mostly portfolio management, M&amp;A, real estate, startup valuation, et cetera. So if you start out with econ major + math minor in undergrad, you'll be an excellent candidate and you'll coast through it.

If you're interested in math, take math. Ultimately, if you really want econ, prioritize the overlap courses if you can so you can get a taste of econ and if you don't like it, drop the minor before you start taking too many econ-only courses."

"The ANC has a much more limited history of terrorist tactics than Hamas, and this is reflected in Hamas' much poorer image in international fora. Hamas benefits greatly when Palestinians are killed by the IDF in Gaza, but if it is found that those Palestinians were Hamas members, the IDF has a more firm ground upon which to justify those killings, harming Hamas' overall quest to vilify Israel in international media. 

I can understand why Hamas would be proud of its membership being part of the protests, and to an extent this is good for their domestic perception, but this pride (should rationally in my mind) be negated by the negative portrayal those dead protesters would (and thus far have) receive in the international media, which I would argue is more important. I think /u/cleomenes_of_sparta offered a potential answer in that this was recklessly intended for domestic audiences, without the Hamas official considering it would go beyond that circle into the international sphere.

"Sure you’re pedaling the same republican garbage.  Climate change is fake, these plans are only to benefit the wealthy, were subsidizing rich people etc.  I also assume you actually don’t have any proof of politicians and solar executives being relatives and mutually benefiting. It is beyond your ability to recognize that yes, some politicians are actually concerned about what 97% of climatologists are warning us about and want to do something. Instead, you attack this one subsidy, but NEVER NEVER NEVER does your kind complain about subsidies to republicans.  Not the ones fat subsidies to the corn growers, the oil companies, and now to the coal miners who fantasize about a dying industry instead of preparing themselves for a new age.

"I dont think you can fully appreciate what it means to run a full node, or propagate blocks to other nodes in the network, without running one yourself. 

At this very moment, looking at my stats since I last rebooted my Bitcoin-qt, which is running as a full node, I have downloaded 775MB of data. 

In the same time period, I have uploaded 60GB of data. There is almost a 100x discrepancy between downloading blocks and uploading blocks. 

Keep in mind that this 60GB of upload is on default settings, without blocking or unblocking or actively doing anything. This is just my full node participating in the network, by being logged on, and doing what it is doing. 

This amount of data uploaded is at 1MB blocks, and this is on a relatively strong laptop, with a fibre connection in one of the best connected cities in the world. 

I doubt I could keep up with more than 4MB, let alone 32MB blocks. You really need to run a full node yourself, and understand how heavy it is to run  it, to fully appreciate why some of us are reluctant to doing anything to the blocksize. "

"I’m not arguing against him, or you, or anyone choosing to lock their firearms up. I’m arguing against expecting it of me as a matter of law. 

A locked away gun is nothing more than a conversation piece that offers a fun day at the range. It is utterly useless in a time of defense. And this goes for ALL safes, even the fancy fingerprint ones in a nightstand or by the bed. As a fun litmus test, set a random alarm for 3:47 am, or so. When that alarm goes off, you have less than three seconds to retrieve your gun and get it on an imaginary target. If that isn’t possible, your safe is storing an heirloom, not a self-defense weapon. 

Please don’t think I am singling you out. I’m not. I happen to think that most people overestimate their ability to retrieve a gun from a locked safe when suddenly awakened from sleep while an intruder bears down on you. Because I know my own limitations, I know a gun in my safe is just for show and shooting at the range. "

"I'm 28 years old with a long term oriented mindset so I'm in a similar situation to you, I've found that I like having most of my money in vanguard's ETFs, specifically VFV  (the S&amp;P 500) is what I find safest and easiest.  If you have a 40 year timeframe, if you look at the S&amp;P 500 over the last 40 years with dividends reinvested you would be up 9094%, so if you invested $10000 into the index 40 years ago, it would have grown to $909,400, and that's just with the dividends reinvested but no additional investments.  So that's where I put most of my money (as well as smaller amounts in a Canadian ETF and International ETF)."

"Here is the thing. If you have agents willing to do it for near nothing they are going to need a lot more business to survive than your home. You say you dont have time to sell it yourself, do you have time to chase an agent who is busy getting more listings so they can run a profitable business? 

Some agents use it as a loss leader, where they will take the drop in commission on the listing so that they get a buyer out of it. But again, working at a severe discount will take a toll on how good they are at communicating and working for your best interests. 

I am a realtor with over a decade in, I personally couldn't discount in that way because I would need to not care how quickly I got back to people if I was busy. I would NEED the next listing always, or else I would starve. So you are then hiring someone to put your house online and then go find more business. My clients pay me to list their home and be with them through the whole process.

Now don't get me wrong, there are full price agents who do just as shit a job. But I feel there is less a chance of it. Getting your property on mls is the key and $1k will get it done, if you are prepared for what could be hassles, or maybe not.

"The press publish what sells. If there is a national campaign about something in the press, that is evidence that it is a national concern. Yes, the press set agendas, but when a sustained campaign like that one continues to be front page news, it is because people buy the paper. If people were not concerned about it, it would not have remained front page news.

Look at the windrush saga. Nobody cared, it wasn't headline news. Guardian published stuff on it for a month or so, still no other papers cared about it. When the public picked up on it, it was headline news. That's the way the majority of headlines work. It's cause and effect, supply and demand.

Trying to draw some distinction between the two and saying that's not evidence of public opinion is simply not true. When people look at public opinion from 40 years ago, they look at newspapers. Nobody is saying certain papers don't have their own agenda, however when a large number of national papers take the same line, that is proof of national opinion. Trying to paint it as otherwise simply isn't true.

"$1000 for 10 pages can include a home page, about us, contact us, privacy policy, a ""services landing page"" and 5 pages of supporting SEO-optimized pages so that sales page makes a lot of attention.

If your clients make $10,000 per customer (like a dentist or boat repair company), them paying $1000 for a 10x return is a no-brainer.

Except everyone and their sons are offering this, and it dillutes the ability for someone more established *ahem* to help out. But as long as you're consistant you will do well. Rooting for you.

I can give you this as free advice:

Collect money up front, even partially, especially if they are new clients.

Productize your approach, i.e., make it as close as being repetitive and consistant as you can. You might be able to get to 5k for 10 pages if you have a year's experience.

Value add. Hourly is unpredicatable. Value added services allow for an understanding of what to offer right up front. Good luck!

"You could load up physical hard drives and ship them tightly stacked with all the new data and you would get a pretty good bandwidth that way. 

I just looked up a Seagate 1TB hard drive on Amazon. It is 150 grams. If you sent a spaceship to Mars with 50 tons of them every 26 months, that would be 333,333 TB. 

333,333 terabytes is 333,333,333 gigabytes.

26 months is around 790 days, which is 68,368,320 seconds. 

Doing the math on that you get a bandwidth of 39 gigabits per second. 

And that's just with one spaceship. 

If you launch two of them every opportunity you get to 78 gigabites per second. If you can fit 100 tons of hard drives in rather than 50 tons you double again to 156 gigabits per second. 

That's pretty good. "
Thank you!
"I sell consumer goods in many different industries, from Beauty to Toys and Games. Currently, I source products in the UK and export them to Europe, as well as selling in the UK. I have a few suppliers in the EU, which I import from and sell domestically in EU countries. There's going to be some downsides. If/when we leave the Customs Union without tariff free access to the SM, it's going to make it very difficult to compete with European retailers, with the products I source from the UK. This is because there will be import duty (from the Common External Tariff part of the Customs Union) on all products I export from the UK to the EU. In order to get round this, I'll have to source from inside the EU to sell to the EU, therefore bypassing the CET as I won't be importing them from outside the EU. This means less opportunities inside the EU, as the wholesalers inside the EU are far less competitive than even the UK and less abundant (hence I export from UK to EU a lot). 

I'm not glad this is happening, but it gives me extra incentive to deprioritise the EU as theres a lot I don't like about the market, compared to the US. The language barriers are a massive difficulty, not only between myself and the supply chain, but for the products. The lack of competitiveness this breeds compared to the US/UK is huge because each product has to be manufactured with a different language in many cases. So the EU market is big on paper sure (still not as big as the US), but the economies of scale you see in the US is incomparable as consumer demand is so much less uniform. This then trancends into consumer culture which differs far more from EU country to EU county than US State to US State (or even the UK). Then petty things which annoy me such as blatent tax corruption especially in the Southern States, with double standards for home country retailers which have a cosy relationship with their respective governments.

So right now I'm not really prioritising the US, as I'm new to the market (started a few months ago) but this gives me extra incentive to do more business there, which I'll have to do to replace the lost business in the EU. 

It's not cost effective for me (or any other retailer) to import from the US (which has a fantastic, cheaper and more competitive wholesale industry than the EU) due to EU Protectionism in the form of the CET. Even moving to WTO tariffs would make it possible for some products before we even get a trade deal, but I'm more than happy to trade domestically in each market for a bit (like I'm doing in the US) and ride the wave and wait for the UK/US trade deal, even if it means losing some business in the EU. It'll be great for most of the US and UK supply chains and consumer in almost every industry (after the turbulence) as our markets are more similar, and the UK retailers/consumer can take advantage of the American economies of scale, which will lower prices. Also the Customs Union stops us from signing FTA's with the entire Anglosphere, who have similar consumer trends to us, making our goods market so much less competitive as there's up to 150% (in dairy for example) tariffs  for anything we buy from them due to the CET. Remember we're an import goods economy whilst most of Europe is export. It just makes so much more sense to trade with countries with similar consumer demand, standard of living and culture for so many different reasons. I could probably write a book on it haha. 

Another quick point about tariffs. Tariffs protect the country's industry that is enforcing them. The EU tariffs apply over the UK but are designed to protect the individual EU industries, which bear no relation to our own economy. Dairy is an example I like to use. Forces the UK to buy dairy from only the EU as theres up to a 150% tariff on it. Why? French cheese lobby (lol) and Cypriot Halloumi. These countries are our friends and all, but we're not a charity. Setting our own tariffs will help UK industries as 1. It'll be so much quicker to do and 2. We can set tariffs for what is optimal for our own industry, not France's or Cyprus'.

So for your first question: Tl;dr - Short term, not great but no disaster, and long term - potentially a positive game changer for not only myself (retailer) but consumer too.

Second question - depends what the terms of the trade deal are. But it would be significantly better than what we have at the moment (overall) and it's unlikely to be too much worse (trade relationship with EU). This is because we're the EU's largest export market for goods, and the power brokers in the EU are all export heavy economies. There'll be a lot of pressure from industry if the EU continues to shoot itself in the foot just to make an ideological point. Worst case scenario, we shift to the US and trade with EU only where we have to, if the EU Commission are that crazy. It'll be more expensive for the consumer (as imports from EU will now carry the CET) but they will save money in other areas as trade with non-EU countries will be a lot cheaper, which we'll inevitably shift towards if the EU refuse an FTA. 

I can't see this happening long term though. It's optimal for the EU for us to stay in the Customs Union, politically and economically,  so they'll threaten no trade deal to try and whip up a frenzy to try and put the pressure on the UK government to stay in. It's a great negotiating tactic - so many people have eaten it up and this puts pressure on the PM to stay in the CU. An example of how well this tactic is working is the disregard I've been treated with in this thread! Haha.

Third question - do you trust all the possible leaders of this country in the next 30 years to use that veto on federalisation? When you consider that the UK voted to be in a trading bloc, and through the backdoor, with no consultation of the people, it's getting more and more like a federal state every decade. If you told someone there'd be no borders in most of Europe in 1996, they'd call you a neurotic lunatic.

And finally. The UK people would never allow that (I hope anyway!). But in the globalised new world, if it's a choice between becoming part of an EU superstate, or part of the US, then I'd rather be in a federation with a more similar culture and language. But I don't think it'll get to that stage.

"Oh no I don't just blame the schools, that's one tiny part of the problem  I mentioned that is long only in years and in my reddit post. I looked up EVERYTHING on erowid, everything. I took pain killers when I was in my late teens, I didn't get addicted to them until I was in my mid 20s when my stomach hurt and I got a script from a Doctor.  I over medicated and he over prescribed.  I had never taken pain killers for a  long enough time to develop withdrawals, I just did them whenever they were around which wasn't often.  I knew you couldn't mix too much Xanax with opiates, I ""knew"" people got super addicted (yep, read all the old and new posts on trip reports on erowid).... Its that reading it on a site I had to delete from my history so my parents wouldn't see I had read damn near everything from ayahuasca to Xanax (can't think of a z one right now haha) isn't how you should learn about addiction.  I felt like a fucking criminal JUST READING EROWID, but I did the drugs (don't like drinking never did, but you understand what I'm saying perfectly) , knew what I felt and was happy that I didn't have an addictive personality.  ALL FOUR WALLS OF MY BEDROOM GROWING UP WERE LINED WITH ORANGE SODA BOXES AND I DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT A REAL ADDICT WAS.  I HAD A BRIGHT ORANGE CUBE SCREAMING I HAD AN ADDICTIVE PERSONALITY AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT AN ADDICT WAS UNTIL ALMOST 15 YEARS LATER? Fuck yes I'll blame my expensive ass education, but I'm not blaming only them. It's an issue from top to bottom.  I didn't get addicted to heroin from the middle east, I got addicted to something given to me by a Doctor, someone I was always told and thought was there to help your body better than anyone else can.  It's a tall tall tree with many branched that goes into politics, racism, oppression of flesh and information, the giant propaganda machine. 

Tldr I agree with you and I'm glad you're not an addict, but I am and I always have been since I was a child, there's something wrong with not knowing I was an addict until I was in my mid 20s, BECAUSE SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO BE TAUGHT AND CAN'T ALWAYS LEARN ON YOUR OWN. The whole system is fucked up and I'm going to change it. "

"Wow, I'd totally move my services.  I've been using Hostgator for well over 14 years now, and they have WHM and cPanel on every account, and their servers and software update all the time.  They will also help you if a major migration breaks your websites, and so forth.  They have also helped me migrate across 4-5 different servers over the years (moving ALL my sites to a new server and making sure everything works.)

The only thing I do not like is they no longer offer monthly plans for any of their hosting, it's all annual.  I am still grandfathered in, but that means if I need to move to a more powerful server I have to pay a year up front.  The price is fine, however.

My only complaint is that their tech support is CHAT ONLY.  There is no phone and no email.  Use to be I could email them, they'd fix it, I'd read about it later.  Now I have to sit with them while it gets fixed.  However, I am sure it solved the problem of idiot customers and having to go back and forth a dozen times, and it probably took much longer to actually resolve problems, so I can live with it.

They are otherwise very friendly and knowledgeable and have been able to fix everything I throw at them, which often is quite complex."

"1. Find a new bank. They’re essentially charging you $3,000 to bank with them “for free”. That’s $3,000 that could be earning interest in a HISA.

2. Make sure your budget is solid. That means not only figuring out your monthly expenses (like groceries, Netflix, and the minimum loan payments you absolutely should be making consistently), but also your irregular expenses (like annual insurance payments, new clothes every few months, one or two trips a year). You should allocate money to every single one of these categories each month so that you’re not caught owing hundreds of dollars all of a sudden.

3. If you have money left over after getting all of the above on track, you’ll need to decide whether to send a lump payment to your student loan (which is charging you 3.95% interest), or save it as an emergency fund in a HI-TFSA (which will earn you max ~2.50% interest).

"Before you start any exfoliating actives (like AHA or BHA), I'd recommend asking yourself 2 things:

1. Is there a problem &amp; could this active address it?

If the answer to either of those is ""no,"" then I would not recommend chemical exfoliation.

But, you mention period acne, so it sounds like the answer to #1 is ""yes."" So, on to #2. Do you use broad spectrum sunscreen daily? AHA and BHA are photosensitizing and will make your skin more susceptible to sun burns and skin damage.

"*All* millennial men, without exception? Nonsense: the age cadre are as diverse as any before them, indeed, more so as life choices widen. Glancing through the extensive literature on this it seems that Millis and GenXs differ chiefly in that the former look to opinion leaders (usually on line) whilst the GenX lot are more inclined to have their own opinions. 

I suspect that the three biggest influences have been:

* The Internet as an omnipresent community that offers normative critique on all aspects of life. This happened after GenX had matured, but Millis were cooked in it and are perpetually looking over their shoulders and conforming to what they see as the consensus trend. 

* As compared to previous generations, Millis are exceptionally well-educated but have been processed through an education system that has been homogenised to a remarkable degree, reflecting official attitudes. Millis conform to this in a way that previous generations do not, in part because...

* The 2007/08 crash combined with the ruthless pruning of commerce in the 1995-2005 period. This means that to find a place you need to be just the right sized pebble, have predictable behaviour and keep a low profile.

"The Smart Visas will be very limited and are for very specific professions. I read that they were only expecting to issue around 200 a year. I think you have to have a job in Thailand that pays around £5,000 a month or similar. You'd need to check, as that figure is only a rough guess. As far as I know, the Smart Visas are not for someone in the OP's position. They are to attract people into professions like robotics, fintech, etc.

I agree that if the OP is going to a country specifically to work that it doesn't sound like it's for tourism, so for some countries a business visa may be better. For Thailand it doesn't seem to matter. 

Most visas to Thailand, including business visas do not allow you to stay long-term. You usually have a maximum stay of 30 or 60 days, which can be extended an extra 30 days, after which you have to leave and come back. But you can't do that indefinitely, as they have pretty much clamped down on it.

I've heard of plenty of cases in Thailand where someone was caught working without a work permit, and they were fined around £10. Other countries would be stricter, but I think Thailand is pretty lenient.

Cambodia has long-term business visas, so that may be a good option. I spent some time in Phnom Penh and quite liked it. Vietnam may be another option.

For the OP, anywhere in the EU is also an easy option at the moment. So he has plenty of good choices."

"Eggs have long gotten a bad rap with respect to CVD because of their cholesterol and saturated fat content. 

Diabetes raises the risk of CVD. So eggs plus diabetes might raise the CVD risk even further.

Pre diabetes and diabetes type 2 are diseases of insulin resistance. This is thought to be triggered by obesity, and some think obesity is triggered by fat consumption. Eggs have fat and including saturated fat.

Insulin production is stimulated mostly by carbohydrates, and to a lesser extent by protein. Eggs have protein.

So possibly eggs could contribute to diabetes by contributing to obesity and insulin production.

Some think that the way to fix diabetes is to stop eating carbs and start eating fat instead while maintaining a moderate protein intake, in other words, a ketogenic diet. Eggs are a very good food from a keto standpoint."

"Sure, but the point is that you can't take the absolute amount of pollution as a measure for how hard a country is trying to fight pollution. People like to point at China and say, look, they aren't doing anything, the US pollutes less! But that argument is just as, if not more, ridiculous as the per capita argument.

The pollution in China is probably going to get worse before it gets better, nobody is denying that. As economic activity increases, more resources are spent, more energy is needed, etc. And China still has a lot of room to grow. But China is trying to limit the rate at which it will get worse. 

The overall smart thing for our planet is to either bring everyone down to a level of development such that pollution isn't an issue, or to limit the amount of people who can reach a level of development before it starts to impact the planet. Since most people are probably not willing to demote themselves to more sustainable levels of living in developed countries, and there's no clear moral argument for keeping developing countries in a developing state, nor any power capable of enforcing a ""development ban"", then it is in the interest, and the responsibility, of a developing country's government to develop (increasing living standards, but also leading/due to increased industrialization). The best we can hope for is that they limit their industrial footprint as much as possible in this process (which China is working towards), and the best thing we can do is to give them clean technologies freely/give them an economic incentive to use these green technologies without hobbling their development."

"Thank you I too know the definition of technology. 



 Yes they develop and design technology but they are not the same as what we call tech. For example would we call BMW and Boeing Tech companies or what they really are an automotive and aerospace companies. Both develop some of the most recent advancements in their fields using software and other new processes but they're primary objective is not to develop that tech but rather a product. 



The problem is when we say Tech we mean computer based and programming not hardware base. Yes it goes against what the literal definition is but the definition isnt describing what we are talking about.  The definition has been changed for the business language.




Google tech companies and the top results are IBM Microsoft and Apple. All these have one thing in common software development and sale of that software. This is where that definition of tech comes from. 





Now back to SpaceX is it a Tech company? Yes, but so is any company that uses technology to develop and sell products. So do 95+% of companies. That's why it should be labeled as a Aerospace company as it's much more descriptive onto what they actually do and the product they sell. "

tax and inflation. 

&gt;wealth will naturally flow from people who make bad monetary decisions, to people who make good monetary decisions

this is called optimization not wealth inequality, we don't have a system where money flows to those who make the best use of it, we have the opposite wealth flows to those who get the new money first and spend it pre-inflation while those who work get it last after inflation. the poor are the last to get the new money and suffer the biggest  impact. 

&gt; it goes 99/1 and beyond and rightly so.

It needs centralized controllers to force wealth inequality, Banks and Governments. Go read your history the Bretton Woods system. Almost all institutions are now corrupted and not serving the people Governments and banks executing austerity is the proof.

"Hello! I'm looking for a new sunscreen and I'm currently considering **Innisfree Triple Care**, **Skin Aqua UV Super Moisture Milk** and **Canmake Mermaid** (not so sure about this one). I'm open for more suggestions.


For reference, I've been using Biore Perfect Face Milk for around a year and I loved it until now, but I started tret a couple of weeks ago and I'm starting to see some dryness (previously my skin was oily, but had it mostly under control). 

I think I'd like a more moisturising, less drying sunscreen, preferably without alcohol. I reallllly prefer a matte finish (that's what I love most of my Perfect Milk), but since I understand it's difficult without alcohol I would settle for a ""normal"" finish. Something non-greasy and as little dewy as possible. 
 I spend 95% of my time indoors and I don't live in a super sunny place.

I'm also looking for a moisturising cream aswell. Most of what I have now are toners/essences (Kiku, HL Premium, Cosrx Galactomyces) and a gel (Cosrx Honey Overnight mask), but I'd like something a little thicker. I was meaning to try Cosrx Snail 96, but it might be too similar consistence to the others, so I saw Cosrx 92 AIO, which is a cream. Are there many differences between the two besides the essence/cream thing? I'm also open to more recommendations here!

"Greed, the longer builders hold onto the land that's already approved to be developed the more money they'll make as real estate prices continue to skyrocket.  They either need to attach fines or penalties from municipalities for not developing in a certain time frame or a timely manner.  But those holding onto land are just speculating and making out like bandits in the Greenbelt.  Opening up everything isn't a solution either, but it would undercut these speculators.

There may be some legitimate delays like sewer and water services, but those holding on for speculation should be building.  "

It's why Sony lost its case when they removed Linux support from PS3.

This would go the same way. Granted it most likely would result in only 100$ which is the high end for such devices like a Android TV box or Roku. Though many smart TVs don't support HDR on all the HDMI ports so you probably could get even more to cover a HDMI splitter that supports switching signal automatically. Many HDR TVs the apps support HDR so it would be even a larger loss to need to use a HDMI port for your streaming box."

If the kids are under 18 and you and your ex have long been apart what a terrible decision for the trustee to make.  What would happen if you were not a decent person and took off with the funds meant for the true beneficiaries (the kids).  What is the fund? 

If the fund is paying to you then there may be tax implications as you might not be a financial dependent.  Tax can be as high as 32% on some of the funds.  Unless they are paying to you as the executor of the estate to distribute the benefit to the children who if under 18 will inherit the funds tax free.  

No way would I get them to pay me directly until we had things sorted properly.  Talk to the fund or their financial planning area.  "

"1.  There is no regulation on the types of panels and what qualifies as a system (developers will install shitty systems with the sole intent of being ""good enough"" for code)
2. The cost analysis is off -- if it truly saves Californians money, then offer tax credits and/or grants or very low interest loans to provide incentive.  There is very expensive maintenance, and the lifetime of a panel is barely greater than the break even point if you finance it (which now, everyone getting a bank loan is financing their solar).
3.  There is no regulating the type of materials used to make the panels, some use highly toxic, non sustainable materials like chromium and cadmium.  There are new panels on the market that don't use those, but aren't as efficient.  We have no solution in place for the lingering solar panel waste problem.
4.  We don't really know which legislator has a hand in the pocket of solar energy installers in CA.  It's like the EpiPen lobby to get laws for schools to have them, followed by a 600% spike in price.

In full disclosure, I would never support mandating behavior like this, but to entertain the notion, it's simply premature.  There are too many issues still lingering with solar that should be worked out before mandating all new construction be solar.  "

&gt; Fared Bakhtawer, head of the provincial council, said several security checkpoints in the city of Farah were overrun by Taliban fighters and that an intense gun battle was ongoing.

"As there is not much time left, the value of each contract approaches intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price and the current value of the underlying stock. In your example the intrinsic value is -$30. You would have to pay someone more than $30 to take your contract for it to be worth it for them.

To answer your questions directly

Do I just let it expire and I only lose the initial premium ($100)? Or does it give me $15 back at the expiration and I only lose $100-15=85?

Most likely it would expire worthless unless someone was stupid enough to give you their money. You lose the entire premium as soon as you pay it. You only get it back if you can sell your options to someone else."

"&gt; Russia and Turkey are geographically in the direct center of the landmass which houses 6 out of the 7 billion people living on planet Earth, plus most of the resources they reside thereon.

Overland trade isn't efficient.

&gt; Russia has more resources and land at its disposal but is diplomatically isolated. 

The US has far more arable land.

&gt; Turkey, with control of more strategic straits and more direct sea access plus the greater potential ability to project power (if it weren't such a basketcase right now) based on strategic location and links with the Middle East

You really think if Turkey wanted the Dardanelles closed and the US wanted them open they would stay closed? No. Turkey would have a coup in minutes, and the straits would reopen. The US controls the Dardanelles.

&gt; On the other hand, Russia will largely stand to benefit from the retreat of Arctic sea ice and be able to gain effortless access to warm-water ports within this century.

Finally, a point actually worth making. Russia's economy may benefit from global warming, certainly relative to the world economy.

Still not enough to compensate for a tiny economy and military though. America's warships will still control major sea lanes and thus international trade.

"787 Fuel capacity = 101 tons.  This is the max with full tanks.  You never fly a plane to where the tanks are bone dry, and not all flights are at max range.  Range is 6430 nmi, while transatlantic distance is 3630 nmi, so rough burn is half the full load, allowing for landing reserves, or 50 tons.

Falcon 9 fuel used = ~140 tons.

So the correct ratio is more like 3 transatlantic flight.  But given the number of airplane flights a day world-wide (100,000), rocket launches are trivial."

"&gt; Not true, there are no border controls.

[Really](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway%E2%80%93Sweden_border#Control)?

&gt; Both countries are members of the Schengen Area, and there are therefore no immigration controls. However, only Sweden is part of the European Union (and crucially the European Union Customs Union) and there are customs checks between the two countries. These checks are performed by the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities and the Swedish Customs Service.

&gt; As it happens, all EEA states + Switzerland are members, hence no controls.

Slightly confusing here, because there are obviously non-Schengen EEA members (UK and Ireland).  You might've meant EFTA states (as all four EFTA nations are in Schengen), but Switzerland is one of the four EFTA members (so doesn't make a lot of sense to mention it in addition)."

"It's not the lower tax rate that is going to help.

In business, to decide whether a project goes ahead, you use IRR or if you're more sophisticated, you do an NPV analysis using your internal cost of capital.

If you're using external debt service to fund your capital projects, you deduct interest charges from your tax obligation. Before the tax plan, you would have done exactly the same thing - corporate tax rate doesn't count for shit (or almost doesn't) when you're deciding whether to go ahead with a capital project.

It has been stated[50] that there are two territories of Japan that have their own local age of consent laws — Marcus Islands and Okinotori Islands — with an age of consent of 13. These islands are small and unpopulated.

https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/10/study-ids-reasons-for-late-term-abortions/

If a terrorist attack killed 13000 infants we would declare war! And that’s exactly what this is. Sentient viable late term preborn infants are dehumanized and exterminated. This is a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions.

"[What is an Executive Order?](https://www.americanbar.org/publications/insights_on_law_andsociety/17/fall-2016/what-is-an-executive-order.html)

&gt;Executive orders are not legislation; they require no approval from Congress, and Congress cannot simply overturn them.

"&gt;I really hope there's still something like raves going on, maybe organized on Telegram or the like.

There is, infact, a heck of a lot *more* going on.  I've been to enough of them in my time.  And yes, they're organised through secret and closed Facebook groups as are many activist movements, including a whole bunch of Bitcoin and crypto groups that are closed.  

As for whether that's all being watched, I guess that depends on the members and whether authorities have learnt their lessons from things like the criminal justice bill (it appears they have).  

I know of a number of well organised secret forest raves for instance, that rarely get closed down nowadays.  It just depends on whether the organisers have a reputation for being peaceful and respectful and clean up after themselves.

Indeed, even during the London riots, and Occupy (which were all organised via social media) there was never a crackdown on social media groups in the UK.  The concern is more with private entities like Cambridge Analytica abusing these tools (and peoples' privacy) for profit.

More and more impromptu raves and festivals are also happening with permission of land owners (many of those land owners are our generation now, afterall).

All of this was of course inevitable the faster and more free information exchange became.  We have Tim Berners-Lee and the internet and music / video sharing services to thank for that.

"To be fair, as someone who's diehard into football, there's more to it than the kneeling for why Reid hasn't been signed.

An example is former Panthers and Chargers safety, Tre Boston. Had a great season last year, never kneeled, but can't seem to find a job.

The problem is the safety market is in a weird situation at the moment. We've had many good safeties hit free agency, like Tyrann and Kam, plus a deep draft for safeties at the end of this month. The kneeling is likely a factor, but not the whole picture.

I don't mean this as a comment to say the kneeling isn't a big deal, it's just important to be well-informed. We're dealing with a opposition based in feelings and emotion, our best weapon is to shut down their arguments with real life facts. "

Harnesses are part of the problem. That’s a FlyNyon issue, but the FAA allowed them to fly with no objections after a random inspection. They changed to FAA approved harnesses before resuming flights.

Liberty’s floats didn’t inflate properly which caused the aircraft to tip on landing.  And there’s the pilot, who has the responsibility of deciding whether to fly - if he deemed harnesses unsafe, if it’s his command he shouldn’t have taken off.

And based on the NTSB report, the front pax created the unsafe situation, leaning back to take a “shoe selfie”, (photo of his feet dangling over the side of the helicopter) which causes the harness to snag on the fuel cut once he sat up again.

"Most single-use plastic straws are not being used by toddlers, they're being used by adults who don't need them, so the comment was direct at them.  I can't answer for every single circumstance and situation in one comment (that's not really possible), but if you have questions about how to replace specific items, you can do a little research to find things that fit your own life.  The subreddit I linked above, /r/ZeroWaste, is one place you can begin if you're interested (there are also lots of youtube channels and blogs entirely devoted to the topic, if you just google them- even ones centered on families with young children).  

------- 

Even if not using straws is a deal-breaker for you, and you absolutely want to keep their function, that's okay.  There are many ways you can begin reducing personal trash creation, if you want to, and you don't have to start with straws (like I said in my other comment, straws aren't what waste-reduction or anti-consumption movements are about). 

And if you do want to start with them, there are almost always less wasteful alternatives.  Healthy adults who don't have a real need for straws can realize we don't have to use them at all.  And if anyone does need them for some reason (toddlers, loss of dexterity due to disease or disability, etc.), there are alternatives.  There may be reusable straws made out of glass, silicone, or stainless steel, that can be used multiple times before donating, selling, or recycling, instead of being used once before being thrown out.  For toddlers, there may be sippy cups made out of similar [materials](https://www.etsy.com/listing/103458953/canning-jar-glass-sippy-cup?ref=similar_items_sash&amp;source=aw&amp;utm_source=affiliate_window&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=us_location_buyer&amp;awc=6220_1524265336_12bd39955b1a9e45beca7a1a4406a94e&amp;utm_content=78888).

Automatic weapons are legal, they're just super expensive as a direct consequence of the Hughes Act passed in 1986. If the Fed repealed that act and allowed post-86' machine guns to be allowed into the NFA registry again, there would be no need for bump stocks as MGs would become less expensive and more available. Additionally, they'd still be subject to the NFA which would mean BATFE approval on all forms,  minimum storage and access requirements, additional taxes, and a registry; all things that gun-control proponents want to see passed. However, because they come with an actual compromise they won't even entertain the idea.

"There are few reasons why your peer would like to close a channel:  
- maybe most funds are on their side, and they need to spend those BTC  
- maybe most funds are on their side and you don't really use your channel at all (they don't earn any routing fees)  
- maybe they want to switch node software, and new code is not compatible with old one (this was the case when LND moved from alpha to beta - everyone had to close channels). Should be less of an issue now.  
  
I guess the bottom line is: typically channels should be very long lived. If you use it - your peer ears routing fees, so wants this channel to be open forever. Rebalancing via LN will allow it to be open indefinitely without ever hitting a base blockchain."

So does that mean the government can get away with any point of failure and not doing anything at all and face no punishment? 

Are we really saying the government can do absolutely everything wrong and all we do is say, ""Well, they aren't perfect. Oh well.""

"&gt; Oh yes it should be a reputed company with high ratio of successful claims

I don't know if there's CSR data from health insurers on number of claims approved. There's data from life insurers; but you won't know which ones are for term plans. I'd assume here also, if the insurers publish data, it'd be highly biased.

As for which company to choose from, see which one has reasonable coverage of popular hospitals in your area.

From what I know; Max Bupa, Apollo Munich, Religare, HDFC Ergo, Royal Sundaram - they are the popular ones. Usually they all have similar claim approval process.

If you take insurance from any of these; be prepared to appeal. They'd most likely not approve your claim, or if they do; will not approve in full.

Also try to have a medical fund - to handle situations like [this](https://freefincal.com/health-insurance-claim-rejected/).

Some say public insurers like United or National Insurance etc., approve claims easily. That has been my experience, with my family members. But, they also have policy clauses that are not beneficial to you, and probably higher premium."

"I live in peace in Woodlawn. No one bothers me, cops arent knocking on my door, no one is stopping me walking down the street on suspicion. I'm a respected member of my community, help my neighbors and give back. I am greeted by name and respected.  So are my friends and neighbors that are black and Hispanic. We are not discriminated against when we go to Katonah Ave to any estaishment there. We arent stopped or approached by the police. Everywhere I go in this country and world I am treated with respect because I act in a respectful manner.  Even in countries where I don't speak the language.  I'm usually a rare sight, a black woman at an ac/DC concert or getting off a plane from  Switzerland, or at a performance at the Met or road cycling up 9w part of the NYCC. Im neither treated in a condescending nor cold manner. Perhaps some people don't like me, that's fine, but it has never been shown to me or impacted my life in anyway.  The only people that have shown me outright hatred are folks that look just like me. I encounter it every day and it's unprovoked. The cashier at whole foods that wants to roll her eyes when I ask for a bag or say good morning. Or the black man that trying to fight me because I asked him not to hit me on the train. Or the black kids that told me to shut the fuck up  and started threatening me because I told them don't litter, respect where you live (white plains road and 232nd street). 

I have a beautiful life that I worked very hard for.  I was born and raised poor in harlem to a single mother.  I was in jail and pregnant  at 19 years old. Served my 3 years probation, worked crummy jobs and great jobs.  I went back to school, got my degree became a NYS licensed professional and have a great career and successful business where I get to help and educate people on a daily basis so they can live their best lives. Never once did anyone hold me back from being who I am today.  To say you don't have 100% control of your life, you are missing out.  Every action has an equal reaction.   The only victim I was of, was my poor choices. 

You talk about living on a block with black people and loud music and wishing it would stop. Call the cops, be proactive. Wishing isn't going to make it go away. This behavior goes unchecked because  no one says anything. Its uncomfortable to speak up but it's more uncomfortable to deal with selfish people that impact your quality of life.  I refuse to let other people impact my quality of life and that of others around them.  I have a neighbor that felt he can park his car on the side walk. I call 311, take photos, tweet and call the 47th pct and contact my local representative.  Guess what? He doesnt park there anymore. He got mad at me and I told him ""be mad at yourself. I didn't tell you to park there. You thought the rules didn't apply to you, you're wrong.  You want to do what you want to do, move far away, buy your own land and live how you please.""

Life is what you make of it. You are not owed anything,  no one cares that much about you to think of ways to hold you back. We are all just trying to make the best of this.  Personal responsibility and being humble are the keys to a beautiful existence.

There have been very few items that he promised on the campaign trail that he hasn't at least tried to get through, if not actually accomplished.  

I don't think there's anything wrong with conservatives having issues with Trump on a moral ground, but at this point I think it would be idiotic not to support him due to his actions and results.

"a gun buyback program where you can sell your guns for more than retail would get rid of enormous numbers of them. after that, with manufacturing shut down, simply confiscate the ones they find. obviously I don't mean search door to door, but like any other contraband. it'll take a long time, but thanks to a rule that I don't remember (inverse square?), there will be a sort of half life and the number of guns will diminish to negligible levels.

"&gt;Aww,,here you go with the ""pick yourself up by the bootstrap"" american disgusting ideology. U realize mist rich people come from wealthy families right? How am I ever supposed to save money when my parents literally have nothing for retirement and I have to be the one to help foot the bill. But you think its just solo easy to just get a bunch of money.

First of all, learn to write in English better before you start whining about American philosophies. Secondly, nothing I said has to do with money, it has to do with ***personal self growth***, which you seem incapable of even understanding the concept.

&gt;That's another thing. Why do I need to have so much money just to have a shot at dating? You are only proving my points about the nature of dating.

Because people want to be with a partner that they can rely upon to be financially (among other ways) self sufficient, it's not that unusual of a preference for both men *and* women.

&gt;I've worked all my life to improve. I graduated high school with better grades than 90% of my class and I went to a good college. But that didn't matter. I was just a poor ugly animal to the women at my ""good"" college. Repulsed by my race and background. Its crushing believe me to have to deal with that for 3 year.

You're more than your race and your looks, and until you acknowledge that and work on improving yourself, you'll always have this nihilistic view of women, which only exacerbates your vile misogyny and bitterness exponentially.

&gt;Melodramatic sure. But I really mean it. I've lived 26 years of life to only be in this terrible social economic position. And no one has any empathy for a poor man.

*Many* people have empathy for a poor man. People *don't* have empathy for a misogynistic one.

&gt;And why shouldn't women go for shy guys? Why are they always attracted to the loudest most obnoxious guys?

Because you're too busy being shy, quiet, and self-pitying to make any action to make yourself noticeable. How the hell is she going to see you're there, especially when someone (who may just be loud, to assume they're obnoxious only hurts your already fragile position) else has captured their attention already.

&gt;Those are the men who hurt women everyday.

They said, with zero evidence or data to back up their claim.

&gt;Shy virgins hardly have the balls to get away with what those men get away with.

***ELLIOT RODGER KILLED MULTIPLE PEOPLE AND AIMED TO KILL MANY MORE***. And you know what? He was as shy as could fucking be.

&gt;But we are the problem? That's what I find maddening. 

Shy virgins aren't the problem, it's your vile and repulsive incel ideology (which, paradoxically [and also hilariously], is the main factor that hinders you from your goal). ***That's*** the problem.

&gt;I bet most of your women friends have been in relationships with the kind of guy I'm talking about.

No, good try. Many of my women friends are in relationships with wonderful guys who are cool as can be, and the ones that aren't in relationships currently had wholesome, stable relationships with partners that for reasons I'm not privy to (and don't pry into because I respect their privacy) decided to end.

So I'm pretty done, because frankly I'm done engaging you as it were. Hopefully you pick up on the advice given to you by myself and others to fix your shit, but you probably won't, and you'll probably go crying to incels.me or Braincels that a feeeeemale was mean to you, so I'm not really interested in wasting my time.

"Could you elaborate on the relationship between changes in the cost to mine a bitcoin and the trust in the system/pricing? You say:

&gt; Perhaps counterintuitively, the price decreases with the marginal cost of mining, which is driven by factors such as electricity costs, due to the reduction in the equilibrium network trust (measured in hashrate), thus reducing the bitcoin valuation.

Does this mean: if mining a bitcoin gets cheaper (i.e if it costs $3000 to mine a bitcoin and an ASIC is released which reduces that to $300), then the effect on price would be negative? Would this be because it is now cheaper to reverse the history of the chain, as equipment is more efficient? And this damages the trust individuals have in the network security? "

Trump has turned national security into just another political act in the Trump reality show.

For the record, Iran never violated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). And there is no evidence the deal is “defective at its core,” as Trump likes to say.

Perhaps it is TRUMP who is rotten at the core."

so u buy now and feel safe that at least 20% of its value will hold? ... why not just let it go when it dips 50%, and buy a different investment?

"Waste of O^2 to worry about prepaids and escrow. After it is out of underwriting, etc, the numbers will all be revised to be identical in the hypothetical world where you order 3 appraisals, submit to underwriting 3 times with 3 different lenders, etc.

Yes, sometimes upfront numbers on the LE are manipulated for taxes and insurance to 'win' business. Generally speaking folks working with multiple different lenders get fucked in some sort of way, this being one of the possible ways, since the behavior rewarded is manipulation over all else. You do not do this for a living, you're an amateur relying on google and reddit. Trying to outsmart mortgage lenders when it comes to mortgages is like trying to outsmart cancer doctors when it comes to cancer.

"&gt;And, considering it's way less practical to ship trash to the ocean for dumping than to land-fill, river-born trash accounts for the overwhelming majority of solid pollution in the ocean. 

Do you have a source for this bit, by chance? I've been looking for statistics on it and so far all I've found (that wasn't referencing the same study as the top post article, which only discuss river sources, anyway) is an infographic to the contrary, showing 0.5 million tons by Rivers yearly, vs 9 million tons by coastal dumping. I've seen some other figures for river dumping going from 0.5 Million tons annually to 2 million tons annually, but having a harder time nailing down coastal dumping stats.

Here's said infographic for reference: http://www.eunomia.co.uk/reports-tools/plastics-in-the-marine-environment/

There's a report behind it, but I'm on mobile so can't download it to scrutinize it more closely right now.

My thoughts are both ways make sense logically. As you say, shipping it to the ocean to dump is logistically costly, but on the other hand there are high population coastal areas such as in India that probably have high dumping anyway. I'd love to have some solid data either way."

"&gt; I feel like you might have misread parts of the article.

I think it is more likely we disagree, and it makes you feel more comfortable posing the disagreement as a mistake I have made rather than accepting I can come to a different conclusion without making a mistake.

&gt;The author is specifically saying that saying things like ""conservatives don't care about the truth!"" is WRONG.

Well actually that specific quote is a general statement and not directed to conservatives specifically. but there is a bit of a wink and nudge in there too.

Secondly - many do believe that a great number of people have lost all interest in evidence or investigation. It's one of the most common liberal memes. ""Fact has a liberal bias"" and ""Conservatives hate science"" is  about as cliche as possible because the dream beat is so constant with it.

And then the author goes on to label them post-truth...

They aren't ""Someone who disagrees"" they are ""Post-Truth"".

The article is about as phoney as it gets in my opinion. It will spend the entire article teaching you to be more compassionate in your condemnation. It is probably the reason it avoids discussing the hate issue, because it is still condemning. But after reading a bunch about a study of Rush Limbaugh and his ilk and all - it was pretty obvious that the few moments of lip service about the left were just that. Lip service.

I agree, after 20 or so paragraphs it tries to claim ""It isn't only conservatives"" - but the article does this in passing and in only a few words as lip service. The main point of the article is ""These people who I disagree with are ""Post Truth"". Let's see if we can label their behavior in different ways, like echo chambers and epistemic bubbles, rather than ""Anti-Science"".

You don't seem to see a disconnect there, but I do. I'd be willing to bet all of my money that the person who wrote this votes Hillary and couldn't agree more with Hillary's ""deplorables"" speech. I'd even be willing to make a bet that the speech was an inspiration to the author.

It's one of the areas we disagree. You use that quote as if it is a example of a compliment... I use it as an example of an insult. Of lip service.

Much in the same way Hillary Clinton and her supporters insisted the ""Deplorable"" speech was only about calling *half* the people who vote for Trump racist, sexist, homophobic,xenophobic,islamophobic - you name it!

But anyone in that group didn't see it as a compliment. They see it as Hillary either calling them racist, or too stupid/desperate to care if they joined up with racists. They try to paint that as a compliment - but it isn't.

&gt;Would you care to elaborate on that?

"&gt; We do not all benefit from the economy equally




I never said *equally*. Obviously we don’t all equally benefit from the economy, but we all do benefit. 



&gt; The more horrific stories would be all the people dying because of abscessed teeth that they didn't go to the dentist for




The USA has one of the highest quality dental services in the entire world and we are one of only a handful of nations who are so rich that we even care about our dental health. 




&gt; For all the people letting chronic illnesses destroy their body to the point that it is an emergency. For all the people who don't get medical care because they can't afford it.




If you cannot afford healthcare, you shouldn’t have others forcibly give you that care. I’m all for giving care to people and making sure that they don’t die, but I don’t believe that the government should enforce this for one singular reason: the Lobby. The lobby pockets trillions off of medicare spending every year, because that spending guarantees them a profit regardless of their shitty low-quality service. Furthermore, the prices skyrocket because they are guaranteed the profit. 



Stop giving away our tax money to rich people. This is what Medicare/Medicaid is. It takes payroll taxes and it gives them to health insurance moguls who lobby and then rack in the cash. They sit back and let the government make their money FOR them without a competitive market to lower the price, which is why healthcare costs have skyrocketed. And what’s your solution? To screw with it more, because suddenly, corruption isn’t corruption anymore if it helps give people free shit. These medicare contractors are parasitic leeches who will kill you to get that glorious government subsidy. 




&gt; Here's you saying only some people deserve medical treatment. I'm quite happy to be opposed to you in this.




Some people deserve to not have the government give their tax dollars away to rich insurance moguls to pocket and then turn their backs on us (like they did with the Affordable Care Act) and raise the prices. 




&gt; I'm waiting for your examples of a free market health service without rationing




No, you weren’t waiting for that, you specifically said in your last comment asking for a free market health service **for those who cannot afford it**. 



Every single fucking health service that’s done with the free market is competitive, which creates higher quality, and they don’t ration at all. Not a switch is flipped on someone. The quality is tremendous and the price is super low. Unfortunately, we only have *some* of that in the USA, but we decided to abandon that for a corrupt system. 



&gt; As it is, clearly we both support health systems with rationing




I don’t support any health system with rationing, but since you said **both**, that implies that *you* support a health system even with rationing. So you would rather ration people’s lives (that could easily be saved by a free market system with low prices) just so that way your social “safety” net has some dead fish in it.



&gt; Me because there seems little other choice, you because you think the less money a person has, the less deserving of life they are.




I never said any of that. Obviously people don’t deserve to die, even if they are poor. People should obviously help other people, but the government should not force this help to happen nor should it let companies pocket off of that help. People deserve quality, even if they are rich. 





I’m still waiting for your examples. "

"I'm muslim, from South Africa though so a little culturally mixed.  I've been investing since September last year.

One thing I know about Islam, is that we are not supposed to contribute money to anything haram, which is why many banks offer a Shariah banking option here, where they basically promise to never lend our money to like alcohol and pornography companies and whatever else is haram. 

Whether or not they stick to it, I don't know. When have banks ever really been held accountable for anything. I think that's been the concern with cryptocurrency though, that it's being used by drug cartels and whatnot. 

I don't think there's been real concern about the gains itself. Like some people will tell you that earning/charging interest is haram. While other's will say it's only discouraged.

&gt;[Do you mean the unmasking by Susan Rice that wasn't actually a thing](https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/11/politics/intelligence-contradicts-nunes-unmasking-claims/index.html)?

Yes.

&gt;Because technically he, personally, was not under investigation at the time. 

Of course he was. They were using Page and Popadopolis as conduits to spy on the Trump campaign. The Peter Stzrok Lisa Page texts are proof of this. McCabe has been implicated as well. Comey kept Trump in the dark because he knew the next step was to investigate Trump directly. But Trump fired him, so Comey leaked memos to justify the Mueller investigation. They had to play their cards earlier than they hoped and it left open loose ends that are slowly being unraveled.

I would never expect someone to forego an inspection, but we had a few offers that stated a dollar value the buyers would be willing to contribute to any fixes that came out of the inspection. This showed us that they were committed buyers who understood the inspection process and wouldn’t run at the first mention of identified issues.

"Not to take away from your fundamental point -- which I agree with -- but in practice there are a couple more steps on the bitcoin side. Namely, you also have to obtain the public key from your 256 bit private key, and hash that public key, and that public key hash has to be in a format that is compatible with the sender of your bitcoins. But still, 3 steps is better than 12, and those 3 are easy to automate -- it's just a button click away."

"&gt; Ryan essentially sacrificed his presidential ambitions for the party by taking the speaker ship.

Yeah, I actually have some respect for him about this. He sacrificed his ambitions for the party. Of course this time he's NOT doing that. Not running now does real damage to the party... but I can't really hold that against him. I think once is enough when it comes to sacrificing your ambitions for the sake of a bunch of people who end up despising you for doing it.

On a related note I really do think we as conservatives have GOT to learn how to compromise. Our society is constantly ratcheting to the left because the left is willing to win partial victories via compromise and then fight on from there. The right meanwhile sees such compromises to achieve partial victory as a betrayal or being a ""RINO"".

"I'm from Venezuela and I actually did the math two or three weeks ago :)

It takes 81.634 btc to change every single Bolivar (Venezuelan devaluated currency) to bitcoin at black market rate (Then 700.000 bolivar/USD, now around 850.000 bolivar/USD), of course, you don't need to change every single bolivar, the whole point will be spark the use of bitcoin for every day use. You don't want to give money away, you want to give people a better money (and any money is better than bolívares) 

Right now, some people are asking for payment in USD in their US bank accounts. So, if I want to buy a car from you, I pay you 1.000 $ from my USD bank account to your USD bank account, the money never entering the country, but the transaction taking place. The goverment can't tax this or do anything about it. This started with big stuff (Cars, real estate, rent) but now due to hyperinflation people are doing it for small stuff (I heard gym trainers asking to be paid on USD!). People are really smart when they need to go around goverment regulations.

So, what do you try to achieve? Hyperbitcoinization in one country. The goal will be to have people transacting on bitcoin instead of bolivares for most every day stuff. You need people buying coffee and business paying wages on bitcoin. The goverment couldn't tax this and most important, it will give people some kind of stability (Bitcoin can go up and down, but bolivar will only go down). Bitcoin is resistant enough that the only way to shut this down is to shut down the entire internet.

So, if somebody is willing to sacrifice say 1.000 btc and receive worthless bolivares with the goal of sparking the use of btc for daily transaction, people will gain interest, demand payment to be made in bitcoin (Some people get bonuses on USD, but most of the population can't as they don't have an US bank account ... no issue getting a bitcoin wallet though) and people will start changing THEIR worthless bolivares to btc. This process will end up with people not taking bolivares and only accepting btc, the bolivar going completely worthless (no one wiling to buy it or receive it) therefore removing the power of the goverment on economic issues and the ability to print money out of thin air to pay for stuff (and destroying any ability to save).

I believe that if this happened, it will lead to regime change. The government is broke and can only pay for stuff by printing worthless money. The government will be unable to buy BTC (as is broke) and mass resignation will come from the military, ministries, and every mid and low goverment ranks (people won't be willing to work for worthless bolivares and the goverment won't be able to pay on btc). This will led to a goverment unable to exercise power and crumbling apart.

OP's cat isn't a lost pet in distress, and it definitely isn't a stray. Unless OP is matching it to a lost cat flyer, randomly taking it to a shelter is just a guarantee that you've separated this cat from everything it knows, forever.

"&gt;Wasn't dividends supposed to be paid out in case of Dividend funds and reinvested in case of Growth plans? 

It's reinvested in both the cases. Dividend MFs just reduce their NAV and pay you, the payouts aren't related to dividends of their underlying investments.


&gt; If only the stock price is adjusting how does the dividend get realized unless a transaction is being done on that date? Equivalent units should be bought with that amount right?

MFs keep cash in hand at times for various purposes. When a stock declares dividend , while the share price decreases - the holders (MFs) receive an equivalent amount in cash.  The NAV of their units therefore remains unaffected even when their holdings are different. If they want they can use their reserve cash to buy additional shares, or just do nothing and wait for the cash received.

This is applicable to both dividend and growth mutual funds, in fact while the scheme payouts are different - they are actually handled as a single investment. Let's say a new MF opens with NAV of Rs 10 for both growth and dividend, now after an year the NAV of both increases to Rs12. The dividend mutual fund would reduce the NAV by Rs2 and pay the investors 2 Rs per unit ... the growth fund stays as is. Now every day, the change in the fund NAVs of both schemes happen proportional to their value (+1% , -0.5%), etc. After another year say the NAVs increase by 10% -&gt; Growth = 13.2, Dividend = 11. Dividend scheme would again reduce the NAV by 1 Rs and pay out 1 Rs per unit to the investors and growth will remain as is.

In reality the things are a bit more complicated due to dividend distribution tax, stt ... but this should explain the basic principle."

Yes, pretty much. Especially public sector unions. It is very hard to fire people from public sector jobs and even worse when they have a union. For example, here in the Washington, D.C. area out local Metro system was found to have lied on safety inspections. They either didnt do them at all or said it was safe when it wasnt. Well the Metro system tried to fire these workers (1/3 of all inspectors) the union defended them and got most of them their jobs back. "

"I'm not quite following the author's logical flows. He starts a *lot* of sentences with ""Socialism is why..."" and then names something that could easily happen under any economic system:

&gt; Socialism is why Venezuela responded to the drop in oil prices with a fresh round of expropriations and price controls instead of cutting back on subsidies. It’s why the government maintained the absurd exchange rates on currency that no longer made any sense as black market exchange rates at the border began to skyrocket. It’s why Maduro refused to even admit there was a problem and instead claimed he was the victim of a U.S. led economic conspiracy to destroy the country. It’s why he lost the service of many international airlines because they refused to be paid at his absurd exchange rate.

None of those things are mismanagement? Like, how does socialism cause this exactly?

&gt; Socialism is why a large portion of the population, who had become accustomed to getting a lot of free or heavily subsidized stuff, went along with all of this. They had been told for years that the freebies were the benefits of socialism. Neither Chavez nor Maduro wanted to explain to them that the free ride had come to an end (at least temporarily) because of international market forces that don’t follow the rules of the glorious revolution.

Same deal.

&gt; The need to preserve the socialist revolution is also why you have roving gangs of socialist die-hards on motorcycles (the colectivos) who take the fight to preserve socialism into the streets and crack heads if necessary. In a word, socialism is the reason the country’s leaders doubled down on a situation that was clearly unsustainable in the long run and then backed up that double-down with force. For socialism to survive, the enemies of socialism have to be ignored or made to pay a price.

Once again, we only have to look at the brutality of the US's expansion westward - granted they had horses rather than motorcycles - to see that this isn't really an issue that's exclusive to socialism.

Oliver's piece seemed pretty well thought-out, but Mr. Sexton's counterargument doesn't really seem to follow any logical flows in terms of saying ""socialism is why this happened, because this behavior would have only been incentivized under a social economic system.""

Like, you can say ""capitalism is why slavery happened, because only in a system in which labor rights are minimized would individuals be incentivized to minimize their costs by buying and selling human lives."" But Mr. Sexton didn't really have a logical flow like that..."

"The offer letter presented to CBP has to have certain info in it like how the company did try to hire a US citizen but none could be found so they are hiring you in order to be approved. If this info is missing then your application will be rejected. For this reason many companies hire lawyers do create a TN package for you to present to immigration.

A TN does not bypass the visa issue. It is simply making it easier for Canadians and Mexicans to obtain a work visa to work in the US and for Americans to work in the other 2 countries.

If a company does not want to sponsor a non-citizen there is nothing you can do. I interviewed with a company and was given a verbal job offer. I had made it clear in the interview that I needed a TN visa and explained how simple it was to obtain it. The managers were ok with it. HR was not. HR refused to approve my offer letter even though I had several people in the company argue on my behalf at how easy it was to get the TN with minimal effort by the company. "
"2000 Cronin memo states that it would be reasonable to require an engineering degree of a software engineer just as it is reasonable to require an engineering degree of someone working in a civil engineering field. 

USCIS employment bulletin in 2005 states that engineers may not hold employment in computer related jobs unless they hold degrees in computer or software engineering.

So as for work as a software engineer, it would appear that USCIS/CBP would require an engineering degree as qualification. And software developer is not included in the Nafta treaty so you could not qualify under that profession."

" Please stop using ""Republican"" and ""Democrat"". I understand those terms relate to positions on bulls98t hot-button issues like abortion, but it is designed to lead to blind casting at the polls. Every candidate should be judged by the merit of their policies, with the people having access to data and information. The old adages of tax breaks and free stuff are obsolete. Tax breaks don't mean more jobs and free programs are not free. Unfortunately, the election system is literally rigged in some critical areas that force a citizen to vote based on party. There, we need a change in law because I am honestly tired of Republican and Democrat. Republicans are the cause and source of me getting raped plus Trump and his nonsense and Democrats stand behind an truly corrupt Hillary Clinton and many other players. If there ever was a divide, it is now gone. They are all the same and I honestly think people's lack of interest is allowing for the BS party system to collapse by no longer gaining staunch supporters out of the youth.

"You're likely correct by saying that OP doesn't have a lot of experience with Node, but just coming here and saying that without any examples or pointers will not help OP improve his library.

OP, take a look at `AlphaVantage#timeSeriesDaily`. Some critiques I would give:

* Please use curly braces for conditionals. Not using them leads to mistakes.
* `const o = res[key];`: single letter variables are usually frowned upon. Pick something descriptive instead.
* `o[""1. open""]`: Instead of using `""1. open""` as the key, create a constant and use the value of that as the key. This also leads to less mistakes and it's easier to make changes to these key names in the future.
* Reading this method's code is really difficult because of indentation. In Javascript it's best to not have the horizontal pyramid that you've created here. Two space for tabs could help with this. This is pretty common style in JS.

For example, I took a geology class.  Geology is not my field of profession nor was in any of my plans.  But I read the course description and it sounded really interesting and it was.  I got to learn something that I had a little passion for that became a big passion for me after the class.

To say that taking a course in college should just help you make money is taking away from the fact that knowledge is good even if it doesnt help you make money.

Exactly. The police don't care about circumstances. It's an easy bust, and an easy fine to go into government coffers. The only thing they'll back off on is a provable example of tools of the trade going to and from work because that wouldn't hold up, and may cause too large a public backlash.

&gt; The court says Special Counsel is overreaching in pursuing Manafort because it is failing to show how Manafort is connected to Russia or Trump.  

&gt; The SC argues they do not need to show a Trump/Russia connection because the SC is DOJ and DOJ can pursure whatever crime they find.  The SC says “We are the Justice Department. We are not separate.""  

&gt; The Court does not accept. You can't have it both ways.  The SC is separate from the DOJ.  You cannot be both ""Special"" Counsel and regular DOJ at the same time.  ""Special"" means you are permitted to operate independently from regular DOJ executive and congressional oversight so long as the scope of investigation is limited and confined to a well defined and pre-authorized subject.  The tradeoff in allowing a SC to operate without the usual rules is doing so within a limited scope.  The SC cannot just police and investigate whatever it wants while not subject to the same rules and oversight that restrict regular DOJ prosecutors.    

&gt; This court says SC knew about Manafort for years, but are only now doing something about it, which indicates to the court that they are simply pressuring Manafort to turn on Trump. This raises a jurisdictional issue. Crimes can still be persued, but perhaps not by SC.

&gt; The court demands to see the instructions Rosentstein gave to Mueller clarificating the investigative scope.  Here's a question, though; if the SC is ""not separate"" and can pursue whatever it wants, AS IT IS REPRESENTING TO THIS COURT, then why would Mueller ever need to request clarification (mutiple times) on the scope from the DOJ?

&gt; This tells us something else.  If there was a Trump/Russia ""collusion"" connection, the SC would have presented it to the court at this time to justify the need to pressure Manafort with prosecution.  But they did not.  Which tells us they can't.  THEY.  HAVE.  NOTHING.

&gt; The Court identified the prosecution of Manafort as, best case scenario a fishing expedition - just hoping Manafort gives in and coughs up something (lord, please anything), or in worst case scenario it is part of a scorched Earth tactic to put fear into Trump and any one associated with him that the SC is coming for them, so they better abandon Trump or bring something to us. You know, a witch hunt. 

The court recognizes all of this.

"No i get all that. I even said we arent discussing the supply aspect because it remains constant but rather the cost of mining 1 btc is going down because the new mining rigs are more efficient. Now granted that will be offset to some degree by new miners coming into the pools which will send the price back up but by how much and when is the big question (since we cannot quantify variables like 1. rate of new miners entering the pool 2. rate of S9 replacing S7 3. Power costs chaning due to regulation etc.) but forget about all that for one sec.

The part that doesnt make sense is where they come up with the $36,000 figure for 1 btc. There is a price where despite the rarity people simply arent going to pay that price. A good example is Osmium. Its 4x more rare and precious than gold but trades at 1/3 the price and while some people speculate in osmium and other rare precious metals there simply isnt enough demand to push that price higher than $400. Same is going to be the case with bitcoin unless something changes to make it more desirable to new money coming in."

"Bitcoin was first adopted by the anarchist/libertarian community. So you should expect theses people to be against taxation, and that is the people who owns the most bitcoins. Secondly, being honest is admitting that theft is immoral, be it committed by an individual, a corporation or a government.

The only solution to this is repealing the income tax or make it voluntary, that means repealing the income tax."

"I think those protests were easier to organize.  You had the youth of the nation being rounded up and forced to go fight a war that nobody really understood, and nightly body count reports on the evening news.  If we had a *draft* for Iraq and Afghanistan, things would be different I suspect.

With civil rights, the racism was so blatant and vitriolic, that once it was shown for what it was on TV screens in the north, people were scandalized into acting.  Dr. King's gamble worked -- there *was* enough goodwill in people's hearts that when they saw people doing *nothing* wrong getting beaten like dogs, they rose up and said ""enough.""

What we deal with now is more subtle.  Economic inequality is rampant, but how do you separate ""legitimate"" economic inequality (lifestyle choices) from ""systemic"" economic inequality?  Systemic economic inequality is a much harder message to get across.  It's a shame that Dr. King was murdered, because he was beginning to pick up that issue.  In fact, he was murdered supporting garbage collection workers who were being taken advantage of in Memphis when he was shot.  Had he lived, we might have seen some semblance of a way to peacefully navigate the issue, as he showed us for blatant civil rights violation.

Systemic economic inequality *doesn't* map directly to race for example, but we attempt to *make* it map (""white privilege"") and then that creates a backlash because it *didn't* map directly in the first place and people sense that.  People in Davenport Iowa or Macon Missouri aren't experiencing much ""white privilege"", so when they're yelled at that they're ""privileged"", they become resentful, and start believing that ""liberals are the problem"".  The left has to hone its message on economic inequality to win these people back from the clutches of the Koch brothers et. al."

Plus they are more hyegeinic than sponges or brushes as you can wash then after using and they're better for the environment than one-use cotton pads or plastic products. 

Why they ever went out of fashion I'll never know 😂😂

"The QAnon stuff is super interesting in terms of how far divorced from reality some of these folks have become. I've been spending some time on the GreatAwakening sub and I'm doing my best to unpill these ""red pilled"" people because the basic premise of the Q theory requires you to accept, at face value, that Trump is a good person and everyone else is a bad guy and Trump is going to take down evil and corruption. Since we know that the opposite is true regarding Trump, you can pretty much reject the entire premise of the QAnon theory based on this. What I really think is that the Trump camp is using Q to craft an alternative narrative to the Russia scandal. The Base is currently so untrusting of the media that will only accept things that come from Trump or confirm their views, so of course they'd be willing to buy into an anonymous online entity who is basically weaving a monospiracy from all these other pieces of propaganda. I think the plan is to get the Base so riled up and convinced of these other ""crimes"" being committed that when Trump inevitably pulls mueller from the investigation, the base will not just let him but encourage him to consolidate power"

&gt; A pen register, or dialed number recorder (DNR), is an electronic device that records all numbers called from a particular telephone line. The term has come to include any device or program that performs similar functions to an original pen register, including programs monitoring Internet communications.

So, it's a device on a phone line that records information... technically that counts as a tap, just not the ""lordy there are tapes"" kind we were all thinking of.  

So yeah, no denying NBC messed up, but I'd think that even this lesser form of tap required a high level of convincing to get one against the president's lawyer"

Nazi Germany was an ethnic nationalist state. Ethnic nationalist states are the worst thing ever and lead to hyper racism and killing people you think corrupt the character of your nation. When Germany stole the Jews land, some Jews rose up to get their land back from the national socialist party and the Germans killed them just c as the Palestinians are today. When Nazi Germany put all jews in the ghettos and death camps, they shot any Jew trying to enter Germany or hanging too close to the border wall. Israel is doing the same thing to Palestine...

Hilarious how his ideologies didn't matter once he became corrupted by his own economic incentives.

"What would be the SEBI category of this fund?

Mutual funds can only invest in publicly listed companies, in NSE or BSE, and their equity derivatives. That too, most funds remain invested in top 500 stocks, even though there are many more companies listed.

To be listed as a public company, a company has to do an IPO. For an IPO to have enough subscribers, the company needs to open up its books and show profits.

Most startups don't have any profits.

Funny thing about the Flipkart Walmart deal; was that they made sure it would be a private transaction for a company listed in Singapore, by reducing number of shareholders (you buy out enough shareholders, until you have 49). Most companies don't like to raise public capital in the first place, because of all the regulatory burden it brings to protect retail shareholders.

To invest in a start-up, you've to get an angel investor or seed-investor license; to disclose to authorities that you've enough net worth to be able to invest in this, and take the huge risks that come with it.

In US and other countries, you need to have these type of licenses, to be able to invest in certain hedge funds. Don't know if that'd be a reality in India.

In your example, what if all 20 companies fail, which is more likely than one of them succeeding?"

"Most foreclosed homes need considerable work where you can not get a convention mortgage loan, the lender looks at listing and says no repairs for normal loan. you will need a a 203k loan. This be a construction loan and more difficult to obtain. You need licensed contracts who get paid by loan company. Look into this. 

If the home doesn’t need considerable work, it is sold as a short sale for market value and you have no idea it’s a possible foreclosure or near foreclosure and there is no deal to be found.  

What I have found is unless you have all cash, you will loose out to investors every time who somehow have $300,000 in cash. While I am sitting here with $5,000 saved up over a year. It would take me decades to get that kind of cash. 

Hard money lenders will give you all cash to buy the house.  You can close in 10 days and they will even give you money for repairs. Now this will come at a premium. You pay points, typically 3 at closing so on $300k loan you pay $9,000 to the lender.  Then each month you pay $3,000 in interest. You fix the house in 90 days and then get a conventional loan.  Total time, 5 months. The experience cost you $29,000 which seems like a crazy amount of money.   Figure 3% if loan amount at closing plus 10% interest each month so you can calculate what you can afford.

"These are very good questions! A property owner does not need anything special to be their own landlord and property manager. However, since you are not on title, you would need to have some kind of authorization.

If I was you, I would hastily speak with an attorney to help you draft a *specific power of attorney letter* it allows you to manage the rental property owned by your mom. This does not necessarily make you the owner. It gives you the authorization to act as the owner in a certain capacity.

To answer your other question, yes, any documentation that you have drafted with your name as the landlord could lead to trouble if shit hits the fan and the Tenant ever wants to claim that you have invalid documentation.

Once you get the specific power of attorney set up, it's recommended you read draft whatever documentation with the tenants or at least create an addendum that discloses you have power of attorney."

...

&gt; Republicans have charged Democrats with unreasonable obstruction of Trump’s judicial and executive branch nominees. Democrats, arguing the president’s picks are unqualified or ideologically unacceptable, have demanded the full amount of debate time allowed under Senate rules to slow the confirmation process.

&gt; **Last week, McConnell threatened Democrats with a weekend floor session if they did not ease the confirmation of a group of Trump nominees. The Democrats ultimately relented and no weekend session was necessary. Expect more of the same from McConnell in the weeks and months ahead.**

Doctors may be employed by a government agency, but that does not mean they bend to the whims of their government paymasters, which is the narrative being pushed here. Doctors in the NHS regularly lock horns with the government in fact.
What exactly is the difference between that and doctors here in the US employed by corporations, or insurance companies refusing diagnostics and actual treatments to patients? NONE.

Concerning the entropy of the user-supplied file, it could be good or bad, depending on what the user chooses. I somehow suspect that somewhat the first half of the bible translation into swahili, or into even a more obscure language, should be ok.

entropy(xor(n1,n2)) = max(entropy(n1),entropy(n2))

I'm dumping live into DynamoDB from EC2 collection points. It's low redundancy right now since an outage affects only me, but that's pretty easily rectified given the setup (which would be the cost of collection I referred to elsewhere.) If this was stored for distribution I'd probably add another step to scoop it out of DynamoDB, do any transformation needed into the appropriate format, and archive in S3 for low cost storage and distribution (DynamoDB is comparatively expensive for storage but offers fast writes which aren't necessary for archival). I'd also multi-region the collectors and compare data across to ensure there are no outage gaps based on regional failure or system updates.

"&gt;I am not the one pushing for a change to open primaries so I have zero to back up. You  are pushing for that change and need to back it up. Stop trying to shift the conversation because you don't have an argument

&gt;I'm not trolling you, I think you really are misguided and naive, and you do not understand my points and assume that I am making other points.
  
Which is it that you aren't making a case or that you are but I'm not understanding your case? You have refused to refute my argument and claimed that you are not obligated to make your own case; you're without a genuine opinion and only seeking to be an annoyance without having a stake in the debate. As I've asked you before, make the case for your opinion in regards to the closed/open primaries (that is if you have one), and not just dodging having to make a case with flippant comments and nothing to substantiate your claims.   

  
You state that I've been using too many words, if that was true then you should have enough to refute my argument for the least restrictive electoral process or at least ask questions to clarify my position; yet you've done none of this just stating that both the onus is on me to make the argument that open primaries are in line with the ideal of universal and equal representation and that I have not met your arbitrary standards (impossible to do since you haven't provided them, nor feedback on deficiencies to my verbose argument). 
  
Given that public funds pay the government employees to carry out primary elections, the ""private organizations"" don't get to determine how the public funds should be spent. What on earth in the above sentence do you have a contention with? What do you disagree about that both the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution (14th Amendment) that the ideal of American democracy is to be more inclusive and more equal in terms of government relationship with the governed?

"Personally, I think it would also be incorrect to assess against the one unit because it's truly a common expense if the tuckpointing is being done on more than just that building. If the tuckpointing were only on that one, I'd agree with the vote. 

On a separate note, I believe this vote could potentially hurt everyone if each of those 8 owners has to come up with a significantly larger amount like this. Right now, if I understand it, 9 units would divvy up the $40k price tag for a total expense of less than $4k per unit. In order to save about $2k, everyone's going to dump a $22k price tag on ONE family, a pretty shitty thing to do, really, but whatever.... The problem arises when that owner can't pay such a hefty fee. The building getting into disrepair can potentially affect everyone else's ability to lease or resell when they need to. (And this is what makes it a TRULY common expense.) 

I think it's a bad decision, but I am not a lawyer and this isn't a legal opinion. To me, it sounds like you (and maybe others) dislike the owner of that building. If you think it should be assessed correctly, maybe it's time to change the bylaws, but for now, the bylaws were written as they were and that clause you mentioned would only be applicable if it was truly ONLY an issue for the carriage house, such as maybe a roof repair.

"I’m not saying that tweeting ‘witch hunt’ is something that could get him charged with obstruction. It is just one of the many ways he is trying to undermine the authority of the investigation- which *is* obstruction of justice. Like you said- firing Comey is itself the biggest thing he did that could get him in trouble. And even that wouldn’t have been a problem if he had just stuck to the damn story. 

Bottom line- even if someone likes his policies, the guy is a massive liability. I find it hard to believe that any generic conservative couldn’t get the same shit done without acting like such a fucking moron all the time. If I liked his policies I’d be even more pissed off than I am now, since he is constantly running his mouth and jeopardizing everything. 

If you like what he is doing in terms of policy, having to argue that what he says might not *technically* be enough to get him charged with OOJ puts you in a shitty position, and you should resent him for it.

"Your use case makes no sense. ""If you put money in the market just before the great financial crisis, you'd have made less money than if you had put money before the 2003-07 bull market"".

You can't use returns in hindsight as a measure for timing the market. P/E or P/B are more useful measures for timing the market, since you don't need to retroactively impose them. 

There's a thread on valuepickr about timing the market wrt Nifty P/E which you might find useful.

Timing the market is not ""useless"", but being successful in doing it over 30 years is very very difficult so unless you're a hedge fund manager, your time and effort is more useful in advancing in your career and earning more money and putting your money in a mutual fund and not worry about market timing."

"It's not ideal, but the train ride from Poughkeepsie isn't *that* bad. It's very predictable. About 2:15 door to door no matter what.

That was far more brutal because it made making plans impossible and I was driving, which sucked ass. Being stuck in a car for an hour is way worse than being on a train for 2.

"I've got a theory on that, actually. 

There are two points this hinges on.

1) The Democrats lost Congress because of the AWB. (Prior to the AWB Republican's hadn't held both houses in a long time.) 

2) The AWB passed because the gun banners were desperate to ban anything, and low information voters are easy to confuse. 

If the gun banners instead had never bothered with an AWB, and instead had continued their efforts on handgun bans we'd have far less conceal carry in the country. They'd also have much better arguments. There's no statistical argument to be made to support an AWB, as well as there's that whole second amendment argument. 

But, handguns? That's much easier to argue in their favor. Handguns are the weapon of choice for criminals for the same reason they're an excellent tool for self defense, they're easy to use and carry. 

And, there's some argument to be made that in order to fight off an enemy to your liberty you wouldn't use a handgun, you'd use a rifle. They could even draw from history and that only in recent times were handguns even standard issue for infantry. 

I really think that without the AWB gun rights would be in a worse place, because we wouldn't have that rally to our rights, and we'd have an opponent who is much, much smarter. "

"Well... here's this.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_electricity_by_source#Lazard_(2017)

First number is low, second is high, these are in $/MWH.

So here's nuclear's price

&gt;* Nuclear	112	183 

Here are renewable energy costs.

&gt;*    Solar PV - Rooftop Residential	187	319
* Solar PV - Rooftop C&amp;I	85	194
* Solar PV - Community	76	150
* Solar PV - Crystalline Utility Scale	46	53
* Solar PV - Thin Film Utility Scale	43	48
* Wind	30	60
* Geothermal	77	117
* Biomass Direct	55	114
* Solar Thermal Tower with Storage	98	181

So all of these except the last three need storage to run all the time. The last three have their own issues though. I love geothermal, but it can only be done is specific geologic areas- hot spots and plate boundaries. If we changed our grid, it could have more of an impact... but until then... it's very limited. 

Biomass... is great when it's waste, not so great when it's causing forests to be cut down and crops to be grown to feed it. And it might not be so carbon friendly... 

https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/congress-says-biomass-is-carbon-neutral-but-scientists-disagree/

Solar thermal... relies on natural gas when the molten salts don't heat up enough... I suppose you could use a tiny reactor someday too though! But for now, it's useful for lowering emissions, but not entirely green.

https://theconversation.com/if-a-solar-plant-uses-natural-gas-is-it-still-green-50046

Okay, so onto storage. So this is ""Behind the Meter Storage"", which means the battery is in the household or in the business. So Tesla's Powerwall.

&gt;* Commercial	Lithium-Ion	891	985
* Commercial	Lead-Acid	1057	1154
* Commercial	Advanced Lead	950	1107
* Residential	Lithium-Ion	1028	1274
* Residential	Lead-Acid	1160	1239
* Residential	Advanced Lead	1138	1188

And this is the ""In Front of the Meter Storage"". This is storage before it gets to the house, so on the power line or generation side. We don't have too much of this. As far as I know, only Australia has any significant amount of this. 

&gt;* Peaker Replacement	Flow Battery(V)	209	413
* Peaker Replacement	Flow Battery(Zn)	286	315
* Peaker Replacement	Lithium-Ion	282	347
* Distribution	Flow Battery(V)	184	338
* Distribution	Lithium-Ion	272	338
* Microgrid	Flow Battery(V)	273	406
* Microgrid	Lithium-Ion	383	386

So the ""10 times"" claim I made only applies to ""Behind the Meter Storage"" and only some kinds. A bit overblown, and I apologize for that.

But. Storage is not cheaper than nuclear in any way. Even the cheapest chemical storage method is more $1 more than the most expensive estimate for nuclear.  Plus with storage you have to produce the energy, so you have to take on one of the solar PVs or wind's cost. "

"To answer your last questions, Muller is technically a member of the executive branch as a member of the DOJ.  Trump has the constitutional right to select his employees.  So ""yes"" I think he could fire Mueller, but the real question then becomes ""would that amount to a process crime falling under the category of obstruction of justice?""  Under current law, only Sessions can remove a special counsel for ""misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of [DOJ] policies.""  This means that since Rosenstein apponited Mueller, it would probably have to be Rosenstein to fire him.

The rub comes from the fact that the last time this happened with Nixon, I don't think it was ever litigated.  The political fallout was too great that Nixon just resigned.  I would argue that under the President's appointment power, he has the discretion who to hire and fire.  But we are in uncharted water into whether the President firing Mueller is a process crime.  

Edit: that isn't to say there isn't a check on Presidential power.  That of course, is impeachment.  If Congress felt that President Trump had obstructed the investigation into Russia by firing Mueller, the House could of course file articles of impeachment, if passed by the chamber."

2. Do you have no interest in investing in large european/American indices? I believe they are very safe as well, providing other benefits that putting everything in MSCI world. I'm thinking of Nasdaq100, S&amp;P500, Euro stoxx 50, Dax30. (only talking about 20-25% portfolio allocation, not 50)

3. I see in your blog that you say to only invest in stock domiciled in Ireland/lux. Is being domiciled the same as trading? I.e. so you would not invest in a ETF that is traded on for example Xetra? Do I understand that correctly?"

"Sort of. In Luther v. Borden, the Supreme Court ruled that it’s not a judicial question to interpret the Guarantee Clause of the constitution, but rather up to Congress and the President. So if they say it’s okay, then it’s okay. If not, then it’s not."
Thanks. I feel like it’s especially important these days to recognize and admit when you are wrong. Too many people are holding on tight to their positions even when they are clearly wrong. It’s really ruining discourse in this country:
"If you put in $5k/year, without employer match and maintain a return of 7%, even at 30 years old, you will still have close to $800k when you retire.

Let's be real, that's not even contributing that much and it doesn't include employer match and it's only a 7% return."

&gt; A 2015 doctor&amp;#039;s note describing Donald Trump&amp;#039;s health as &amp;quot;Astonishingly excellent&amp;quot; was dictated, it turns out, by Trump himself, according to the doctor who signed the note.

&gt; Earlier Tuesday, Bornstein said the longtime Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller and two other men had conducted a &amp;quot;Raid&amp;quot; on his offices for Trump&amp;#039;s medical records in February 2017, two days after Bornstein told a newspaper that he had for years prescribed a hair growth medicine for Trump.

&gt; Trump in the past has pretended to be his own spokesman and was said by people who were there to have dictated aboard Air Force One a statement issued by Donald Trump Jr to explain why he met with Russian operatives at Trump Tower in June 2016.

"Why are we still talking about Hillary and her health? For the simple reason that it has become abundantly clear that Clinton's poor health was covered up during the campaign, and the Democrat leadership was certainly complicit in that. 

This is the same party that a decade ago let fly with public concerns about John McCain's age and health, stating that should he win, Sarah Palin would be a ""heartbeat away"" from the presidency.

But when Hillary was running, mentioning her health was dirty pool, smear tactics, a cheap shot. But it wasn't and it isn't. For whatever reason, they continue to mask her issues. 

I can't help but think that she is arrogant and delusional enough to consider herself the front runner for the Democrat nomination in 2020."

"Ok.  So how would that work then?

Let's play a mind exercise.  Let's assume BTC has gained full international adoption.  You get paid in BTC.  You get 10 BTC per year salary.  Everything around you is price in BTC, and likewise the price does not fluctuate based on fiat conversion regardless if up or down.  

How would that work when BTC is deflationary?  Mining will eventually stop producing coins, if not already there in this scenario.  People will lose their private keys.  People will die and nobody knows their key.  The circulation will decrease, and thus value MUST go up.  Which means your salary goes down yearly, not up.  The price of houses, cars, and coffee must go down, not up.  So every year you are increasingly less able to repay that 57 BTC loan anyhow."

I think you’re confused. Hamas rules the gaza strip. Fatah controls the west bank. They are two completely different political parties.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.aljazeera.com/amp/indepth/features/2017/10/hamas-fatah-goal-approaches-171012064342008.html


&gt;Hamas is too deeply rooted, and there is too much deep-seated hostility, for this to be a viable option. Hamas have literally dug tunnels into Israel to carry out terrorist acts. You can't just turn around and make these people citizens.

Just because Hamas are radicals, doesn’t mean the west bank fatahs could ‘t be vetted and granted citizenship. The west bank has been relatively well behaved for the most part compared to gaza.

I think overall allowing euthanasia would make the world a better place and people would suffer less. But I think there are valid concerns with euthanasia based in real fears, as opposed to, say, the abortion debate, which is mostly ideological (though I've no doubt there are some who are against euthanasia based on their religious and ideological views)."

As for the anti ballistic missiles,  we actually had that program up and running in the 60s. Check out the wiki on the NIKE program and its predecessors. 

I'm out of the loop now but 2 ticonderoga class cruisers were converted to ballistic missiles defense to test. One of them shot down a satellite (port royal or maybe lake erie).

"I agree, it's true. Black people are statistically more likely to commit violent crime than white people. Statistically, they're 4-5 times more likely to commit a violent crime.

But so what? The incidence rate is so low, it makes no practical difference. Statistically, a random white people has a 0.14% chance of assaulting you, a random black person has a 0.55% chance. Nobody thinks in percentages that low.

&gt; it's kinda like being aware of the difference between swimming with some box turtles and swimming with some snapping turtles.

No. That's not what it's kind of like.

It's more like choosing to swim with some Koi fish and some Carp fish. One is more statistically likely to attack you. But do you give any shit which one? No, because neither are likely to attack you. It doesn't matter that one is multiple times more likely to attack you.

"The FCC is designed to be partisan.

""The FCC is directed by five commissioners appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate for five-year terms, except when filling an unexpired term. The U.S. President designates one of the commissioners to serve as chairman. Only three commissioners may be members of the same political party. None of them may have a financial interest in any FCC-related business.""

The convention is that the minority party recommends to the president their own names for nomination as their two commissioners (like McConnell recommending Ajit Pai to Obama to be a Republican commissioner). When you have the president nominating 3 commissioners and the minority party nominating 2 commissioners, you will obviously see them nominating people who support their party platforms. This is why all 3 Democrats voted for Net Neutrality regulations in 2015, making them law, while both Republicans voted against. It is also why both Democrats voted against repeal and all 3 Republicans voted for repeal in 2017.

People voted Republicans for de-regulation, well obviously Republicans would appoint commissioners who want to repeal Net Neutrality regulations. That's what they've been saying for years.

&gt;**Two high-profile Republicans blasted President Barack Obama's net neutrality proposals on Monday.**

&gt;**Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urged the Federal Communications Commission to dismiss the president's plan, saying it favors ""more heavy-handed regulation that will stifle innovation.""**

&gt;""The Commission would be wise to reject it,"" the Kentucky Republican, who's widely expected to become the next Senate majority leader, said in a written statement.

&gt;Obama announced a series of proposals that he argues would keep the Internet open and free. But in order to ensure the success of his plan, it would require adding regulations that Republicans don't want.

&gt;**Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, argued the net neutrality is the same as ""Obamacare for the Internet.""**

&gt;He argued that more regulations could let the government control the prices, terms of services, and types of products for consumers.

&gt;""The Internet should not operate at the speed of government,"" he said on Facebook.

"Not by a long shot.  The southern half of the country has a lot of security issues.

"He extorted sex. And did so against minors. That's seriously fucked and he deserves harsh punishment.

But I didn't see anything about him moving women around for an illegal sexual purpose, so I don't know why the fuck this gets classified as ""trafficking.""

There'd be no greater sympathy for this man if his crimes were described accurately."
"There are multiple conflicting concepts in play for police here. The first one being that law enforcement is breaking the law, yet not being held accountable. How do you (not you, specifically those that are defending police) defend a group that breaks the law while being tasked with enforcing the law? A second one being that police have the job of enforcing the law, and do nothing about it when that fellow officer breaks the law. How does wearing a badge get you out of legal trouble if you are surrouded by law enforcement while breaking the law? A third one is that people say police sign up to help people. How do you help people by allowing fellow officers to commit crimes by standing aside? How does that help people at all?

(Again, the use of ""you"" in this context is not meant you specifically, it is in reference to police officers and their defenders)"

"I would second this. If you can afford to rent and keep the home, and rent it out then I would do so if it we're me.

It'd be a nice write off at the end of the year at least, with depreciation, interests, taxes, etc... 

A lot of people in LA do that same thing. Buy something, fix it up, and rent it out, then rent a place unaffordable to buy but perfect to rent closer to the beach or better schools. Makes sense.

"When shopping for interest rates between lenders - you want to focus on the following:

1) Interest Rate
2) Lender's Fees (those fee on the Loan Estimate in A &amp; B bucket)
 - Particularly points - in the A bucket
3) Mortgage Insurance - if you need it

All the other fees in the DMV area should be the same regardless of the lender. 

First, the real estate taxes are determined by the home. Second, you get to shop for your homeowner's insurance. Third, you should have been able to pick the title company, so those fees will be the same regardless of your Lender. Similarly, your transfer taxes are based on the sales price.

When shopping between different lenders, make an excel sheet with the following. Top Columns - different lenders and on the lower side: compare the following:

1) Interest Rate
2) Origination Points
3) Mortgage Insurance Monthly
4) A+B fees (all the lender's fees - underwriting, processing, credit, flood, appraisal, tax service etc. My company has a flat fee - other break it out individual - either way - add them up)

"Maybe Satoshi doesn't move the original blocks because he bought into bitcoins mined by others early on, trades some, kept some, gave some away in exchange for pizza and generally helped bc gain traction.   
It doesn't have to be that either he exited early or that he has fiat elsewhere. This isn't modern politics of ""choose one or the other"". "

"In a system that uses CT, if someone finds a break in the fundamental security of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), he can print money. Worse, because the amounts are all private, he can do so *undetectably*. That's an existential threat for a currency which has controlled inflation as prime goal.

Such a break would be dangerous for Bitcoin (even without CT) regardless, as it relies on ECC for protecting against theft. However, Bitcoin can migrate to use a different signature scheme if necessary. It would be chaotic, but not necessarily pose an existential risk.

There are people who agree with this perspective. It's a mathematical fact that any privacy system that hides amounts and is built on top of ECC will at least have one of the properties below:

* An ECC break will permit printing money undetectaby.
* An ECC break will permit deanonymizing amounts in the historical chain.

So we are faced with a choice between those two regardless if we want better privacy. Some people believe the second is worse than the first, and choosing the first actually allows for more efficient technology. This is a choice that Zcash, Monero, Grin,  all make. CT with Bulletproofs would do the same.

However, regardless of your own opinion in this matter, Bitcoin's evolution is a large collaborative process, where such fundamental changes need buy-in from large parts of the ecosystem. My fear is that the question of giving up the ability to exactly audit the monetary supply is going to make it hard to make CT acceptable.

Furthermore, there are other challenges. CT makes transactions larger, slower to verify, and poses a very significant engineering challenge to incorporate into Bitcoin without breaking backward compatibility.

There is lower hanging fruit to improve, thankfully.

"Became a Fi customer recently when I switched from Verizon.  

I had the lowest cost tier for a smartphone on VZ, lowest data caps as possible, and my bill increased every single month. Started around $60-65, and went up by a few pennies every month until it was near $70.

Still the same plan, just more taxes and fees every month.

Switched to FI, my bills have been $26, $30, $25 so far, and it's the best thing ever!  

The truth is the cellular Fi service does not work great at my house, but it works great everywhere else. At home I only use WiFi, and I haven't looked back since."

&gt; If you don't want me to accuse you of repeating Republican lies, stop repeating Republican lies.


Which factual statements that I have made are not true? If they are false, I will correct them. If they seem to be false, but merit further discussion, then I will clarify. 


That's fine if you think that all Republican talking points are lies. But I don't think that's true, 


&gt; I've heard your “self-formulated” opinions many times before. They are not even remotely original.

I'm not claiming them to be original. It wouldn't surprise me that Republicans sound like broken records just as Democrats sound like broken records. But let's just move on from this point.

&gt; You are in error. It is entirely possible, and desirable, to establish a balance between free enterprise and regulation in the public interest. Your ideological extremism is unnecessary and harmful. Stop it.

Can you explain to me why it is harmful? 

&gt; It isn't. Title II has served the United States well for decades in regulating telephone service, and applying it to the Internet has not caused the sky to fall. Your fear here is quite unfounded.

Why do you think Tittle II has ""served the United States well for decades in regulating telephone service""? What makes you say that? Can you make a philosophical and historical case for why the government has ""served"" the industries it has regulated ""well""?  

&gt; That is a misconception. We are in favor of government that serves the public interest, and in particular, enforces balance and fairness wherever market forces don't. We do not concern ourselves with its size, because that isn't what decides whether it's helpful or harmful.

Thank you for the clarification, really. In terms of general sentiment, I agree with you. I ultimately want a government that serves the public interest. My concern is that in an attempt to serve the fleeting and contemporaneous public interest - an interest that is, IMO, indistinguishable from popular opinion - we are creating laws which have a net bad effect. I also think that we, as humans, are great at working towards making a profit, but we're terrible at trying to do things for the greater good. As paradoxical as that may sound, and I'm sure you might be thinking, ""then why is this guy in favor of less regulations"", I think that the incentives of individuals working in businesses lead to better things than do the incentives of individuals working within a government. 

&gt; As you should be. The Republican party seems to be doing its best to dismantle this country from within, and replace it with an authoritarian dystopia in which everyone that isn't rich is a slave to someone that is. 

I disagree. I think it's removing the clout of the federal government, and allowing states to decide how to handle its internal affairs. I think the principle of subsidiarity is a good principle to have: those closest to the problem should rightfully be the ones to address the problems. 

&gt; What they're doing is an existential threat to the United States and the freedom of its people—including you. They must be voted down.

Let's just respectfully disagree.

"Generally, property to be used for your personal enjoyment should be owned personally. By owning it via a corporation you will incur a benefit when you (as a shareholder of the corporation) use the property; the value of that benefit is then included in your income under 15(1) of the Income Tax Act.

It's also typically easier to transfer a personally held property to a corporation without triggering an immediate tax consequence than the reverse. So, if in the future it makes sense for the property to be in one our your companies you could transfer it then (for, say development if the zoning changed).

Also, generally, rental property income is taxed disadvantageously in corporations so there would most likely not be a benefit of owning the property corporately if you plan to Airbnb it.

I recommend speaking with your accountant, but I suspect purchasing it personally is the better choice."

"North Korea will only give up its nukes for one thing; the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.

And *not* because it's afraid of an American invasion or ""regime change"", but because US troops are standing in the way of an easy takeover of South Korea, which has been the core mission of the Kim Regime since the Korean War.

More specifically North Korea's strategy for the past several decades has been to develop a nuclear arsenal large and efficient enough to scare the US into pulling its troops from South Korea, to scare South Korea into kicking US troops out, or to trade in their nukes for either.

It then wants to coerce South Korea into ""Reunifying"" with them in a one-country/two-system union or confederation, so that it can then spend the next several years slowly draining the South of its wealth, rights and sovereignty (until it is weak enough to be made a permanent tributary/vassal/puppet-state of the North, or to be toppled and absorbed completely.)

"You meant to say not innocent? Because doctors are usually, in like 99% of cases, innocent. 

I've read the doctor's speech, Tarek Loubani was his name. He said he was 25 meters from the center of protests, and 35 meters from the fence, during a supposed calm.

I'm still trying to get answers from Israeli infantry combat specialists into how and why a doctor may have been shot, but it may take time until I get a proper answer (the guys at the forum I attend just don't talk very often). 

Anyway, here are a few reasons why the doctor may have been shot in his legs, without needing any experts:

1)He was well within the 100 meter demilitarized zone. At first the DMZ was 300 meters wide, but it was reduced to 100 meters to reduce casualties. As a doctor and cooperative of the local government, he, more than anyone else at the scene, should have known that it was strictly forbidden to enter this area unless he had an agreement with the IDF's coordination unit. This leads me to the next point.

2)For medics/doctors to evacuate injured from the fence area, they need an agreement. How is it done? A simple phone call to the local coordinator, whose number they should have known (Israel drops leaflets, sends messages via SMS, radio, TV, and loudspeakers on the ground). Other than the means I stated above, that number is made available to them when they enter the Gaza strip, and can always double check in any of the IDF's websites.


But there is still no answer from the IDF. They said recently that some of the dead (overall 8 innocent people) and injured were targeted by error and are investigating things including the maiming of the Canadian doctor."

**Beauty of Joseon Cream** \- I find it to be very light and silky; it has a nice \(possibly floral?\) scent to it that isn't too overpowering which I like because while my skin isn't sensitive to fragrances, my nose is. It takes a good few minutes to absorb into my skin given that it's towards the end of my routine but it gives me such an amazing glow right before bed. I use it every night and it's done a very good job so far with brightening my skin thanks to the niacinamide. I bought it about 2 months ago and am roughly 1/2 \-2/3 done with it \(the container makes it hard to gauge how much product is really left\) but I like it a lot and am currently considering a repurchase for summer when the price is right. 

**Hada Labo Milk** \- This is definitely lighter than the Beauty of Joseon Cream. It's a bit runny which I like for morning applications after using the HL Moist. In terms of effectiveness and hydration, I think that the HL Moist is really the player pulling most of the weight in this tag\-team. It absorbs quickly and is overall a decent day moisturizer if you don't want to put on heavy items in the morning. Its quite affordable given its price\-to\-product ratio and I think one bottle lasts me like 10 months.

**Tsubaki Volumizing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner** \- It. Smells. So. Divine. It definitely does its job volumizing the life out of my hair but doesn't do anything to help with a dry scalp. I shampoo twice a week and the lift it gives lasts about a day and a half for my Asian hair. 

Hope this was helpful!"

"Those Calgarians were decided votes *before* Notley was even elected. 

No Notley did not win via vote splitting. She won because she was the best leader any of the parties put forward. 
If Wildrose never existed [she still would have won](http://www.threehundredeight.com/2015/06/without-wildrose-or-divided-right.html?m=1) because the ""vote split"" was a myth people were voting against the PCs and for her. Wildrose voters wanted anyone but the PC to win. Wildrose was the protest vote not NDP. It was a broken party that Prentice had nearly succeeded in a hostile takeover of. Their leader's speeches and debate performance was uniquely cringeworthy 

Then there's the fact that [it's not as simple as WR+PC=UCP](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/alberta-united-conservative-party-1.4218861)
The fact is most *progressive* PC support is going to go over to the Alberta party under Edmonton's popular former mayor, Liberals and yes Rachel Notley's brand of centrist NDP. 

Those ""many voters concerned about a second NDP government"" were the same loudmouths proposing a ""kudatah"" of the first. They're never going to decide any election as their votes are locked in with the farthest right party. 

Notley won a landslide majority in an election with the highest turnout since 1993. The sooner you accept that the better in touch with reality you will be. You're very obviously living in a conservative bubble and don't interact with progressive Albertans. Just remember that Edmonton has the same population as Calgary... and Calgary has a progressive mayor, two liberal MPs etc etc and you'll understand why it went orange last time. I highly doubt you'll ever find a Notley 2015 voter who will be voting for Kenney. They're at most going to stay home vote ABP or Libs. 

You're just suffering from selection bias of only talking to people who hated Notley *before* she took office."

Other deterrents to this in the U.S.

* U.S. energy industry - they make more money supporting POV gas consumption.

* Track infrastructure has always been privatized in the U.S. which lags safety and innovation. 

I live in Minnesota and even though all the research, statistics, and common sense prove all day and night the metro areas and state need to roll out more citizen rail (including high speed links between Duluth, Minneapolis-St Paul, and Rochester) it gets defeated every year.  Road infrastructure cannot keep up with population density and development.  There are scare campaigns every year to keep it from being voted on (drop real estate value, increase crime, etc) locally. Hell, there was even an older metro infrastructure still present in the Twin cities that they tricked into converting to greenways instead of a small investment in upgrade and conversion to an ART system and seperate greenway developments."

"Aurora has created quite a bit of uncertainty with the pending deal and its looming completion near to eom July so at this point (at least for me) it's hard to get a handle on a proper price range at ""current"" full valuation and I think the market is pricing in that uncertainty as well as pending dilution fears. Personally I'm going to wait until the dust settles."
"True, at this point 2018 is just a write off in terms of ATHs and anyone who predicts 50k by Dec is just being delusional and not looking at the charts and fractals. We are going to be ranging and in bear territory for a while. Look at the drop off after the first $1100 bubble burst (mt gox) the price kept moving up and down for a long time. It went to $400, then up to $800 then back again to $300 and kept ranging there for a long time. 

The current bear market is done only when the price breaks $12k again unfortunately it is gonna take a while. "

That is what makes cars so effective, because they are not stuck to a rigid bus line."

"Yeah, I thought it was quite insightful, though I think Breakenridge was a little wide of the mark in proposing his solution: access to contraception would not be an acceptable mitigation to the Catholics of the pro life movement.

I strongly concurred with him about the use of graphic imagery and making comparisons to the Holocaust. These aspects of the pro life groups is what has kept me far away from them, even though I agree with their moral opposition to abortion. Nobody is looking at a picture of dead fetus and saying ""Well, I was on the fence, but now you've convinced me,"" and when the way the message is being conveyed doesn't have any effect, what is being accomplished? 

One thing I would disagree with Breakenridge about is the effectiveness of these marchs: everybody is talking about abortion again. At the very least, they are helping to ensure that the debate stays alive, and to be able to steer the public discourse toward any subject is a hell of a thing in this day and age."

"I'm from Canada and one glaringly obvious thing to me is how much money is spent in the US on marketing and administration. There are many jobs in US healthcare related to insurance that simply don't exist here, and they suck up billions in healthcare dollars. It's also remarkably odd to see billboards and ads advertising hospitals. 

I work with a dual citizen nurse and he told me that hospitals he's worked at in the US have entire administration buildings while similar size Canadian hospitals he's worked at have a fraction the amount of space and resources dedicated to administration. In short, a lot of US healthcare spending isn't spent on healthcare."

"&gt; our argument is that everyone from the Government itself, to the LSE, to the OECD and IFS are all wrong, because you somehow know they all used the same models that aren't right?

Yes. And you can through the ONS in there as well for good measure. Because they are all using the same models. Every time a new report is released I go and check the source material rather than the newspaper report, and I look for their methodology. I find out what models they are using and how they came up with their assumptions. In the case of the latest report they made it very clear that they were using CGE models, and that the assumptions were input via polling.

&gt; Which then leads to, do you honestly think there's a mass conspiracy to make Brexit look like an absolutely farcical mess?

No it is not a conspiracy. I don't believe in conspiracies really as they are just the fantasy of people who cannot be bothered to investigate honestly. What is actually happening is gross incompetency in the field of macroeconomics via the adherence to neoclassical systems of analysis that were invented in the 1920's and are almost religiously followed despite the fact their predictive power is almost zero.

You try to make it sound like these are all separate reputable sources, in the idea that - much like a historic investigation - if we find corroborating evidence in multiple places then it strengthens the case. But much like any historical investigation we need to ensure that the sources we use are discreet and independent. After all if 10 people tell you the same story then it is a lot less likely to be true if they all heard it from the same man down the pub.

This is what is happening here. All of those institutions are adhering to neoclassical models. Whether you use NiGEM or COMPASS, or any other brand of DSGE / Rickardian modelling is pretty irrelevant because they are the same model at their core. That means if one is wrong then they all are.

It is also why, if you'd care to investigate, nobody who is accountable for the results of these models (e.g. companies who trade in the market) actually uses them. It is not a conspiracy - these people honestly believe that what they are saying is true. Hell I bet they'd even tell you that their models are based on Keynes' General Theory, when in fact they are just using Hicks' interpretation which ignores all he says and just restsates neoclassical theory. I mean did you ever wonder why the post-Keynesians disagree so much with the Keynesians and neo-Keynsians?

Well, good job it isn't then."

"I don't see why it has to be objective in the sense that god made morality. Do you care about happiness, well being, equality, etc.? There are objective steps we can begin to take if we agree on something as a goal. Our society has agreed that life is preferable to death, so we do made laws for murder. In my country, liberty and freedom are agreed upon goals, so we disallowed slavery.

We objectively share limited space and resources. Once we establish subjective goals, we can take objective steps to achieve them. Do you care about well being? If so, great! Me too! Let's protect each other's well being by agreeing not to try to murder each other. If you don't care about well being... I don't believe you. If you seriously don't, actions against it will result in a consequence from the rest of us who do.

Also with god you have to decide whether something is moral because god said so (this would make it subjective and morals can change if god changes his mind), or is god saying it because it's already good? For the latter, god is irrelevant to what is good. "

Meanwhile, supply requires a certain amount of willingness - it's not as easy to find a sex worker as it is, say, a line cook.

"Since your mortgage is already insured, as long as you don't want to take out more money (They probably won't let you) you can renew your mortgage with your current lender or switch/transfer to another lender.

"&gt;You can live in a sci-fi fantasy world or you can help fix our planet. You can’t have both.

You can, it is not like humanity can only focus on one thing at a time. Also, the amount of resources spent on spaceflight is very small in the big picture, and that likely wont change anytime soon, so you dont need to be afraid of wasting them resources.

Most importantly, technology required to live in space would certainly find great applications for sustainable living even here on Earth. On Earth we can still afford to waste resources. In space that is a death sentence, there are no fossil fuels and even air has to be recycled. So space colonization and protecting the Earth environment are very complementary things."
"I love this part about Roger Keyes as well, who turned up to the debate in full uniform:

Sir Roger Keyes, Conservative Member of Parliament for a constituency in the naval town of Portsmouth, a naval hero of World War I and an Admiral of the Fleet no longer on the active list, spoke on the conduct of naval operations, particularly the abortive operations to retake Trondheim.[13] Harold Nicolson called it the most dramatic speech he had ever heard. In full uniform with six rows of medal ribbons, Keyes told the House:

“	I came to the House of Commons to-day in uniform for the first time because I wish to speak for some officers and men of the fighting, sea-going Navy who are very unhappy. I want to make it perfectly clear that it is not their fault that the German warships and transports which forced their way into Norwegian ports by treachery were not followed in and destroyed as they were at Narvik. It is not the fault of those for whom I speak that the enemy have been left in undisputable possession of vulnerable ports and aerodromes for nearly a month, have been given time to pour in reinforcements by sea and air, to land tanks, heavy artillery and mechanised transport, and have been given time to develop the air offensive which has had such a devastating effect on the morale of Whitehall. If they had been more courageously and offensively employed they might have done much to prevent these unhappy happenings and much to influence unfriendly neutrals.	”

The House listened in breathless silence. Keyes finished by quoting Britain's greatest naval hero:

“	There are hundreds of young officers who are waiting eagerly to seize Warburton-Lee's torch, or emulate the deeds of Vian of the ""Cossack"". One hundred and forty years ago, Nelson said, ""I am of the opinion that the boldest measures are the safest"" and that still holds good to-day.""

"They can but it would be at the expense of their own profits as it would be wasted work. There would have to be enough miners who want the old version running to continue the chain. 

However, since this is a generally agreed upon upgrade, there will likely be no 2nd chain. Users will just keep using it the same way.

PS: some people are trying to make hard forks seem dangerous or that it will cause 2 chains etc. This is because they don't really hard fork (hard fork requires most users to upgrade their own software) where soft fork forces users to follow regardless. So they try to  spread confusion on hard forks.

Miner 1: 40% hash chain 1
Miner 2:40% hash chain 2
Miner 3: 20% hash chain 1

In this example chain 2 would suffer as most people and hash rate are going for chain 1. The chain 2 miner would have to constantly be losing profitability to keep mining chain 2, but everyone else is chain 1. This WILL result in 2 chains, HOWEVER, chain 2 will not make it far or be built upon while chain 1 works beautifully and continues. Chain 2 eventually fails when the miner gives up because no one is using it.


If this lower part is too confusing, just ignore it:
Honestly, if its easier to imagine. Same thing happened with bitcoin cash, the difference here is that the bitcoin cash chain had enough hash rate at the split to continue, even until today, because people are interested in it. If there are 2 identicle versions of BCH except one has the new OP codes, there's no reason for everyone to keep mining the non-op code chain so there little chance of two chains."

"It’s a bit of a rant but yes, the overall situation for you and others is outrageous. For adults in their 30s to have to be flatsharing is really unfortunate, in the context of all the new builds going up with laundered money. No chance of putting down roots, even renting in the same area for years means nothing. 

However, in your situation there's a bigger element of control. You can comfortably afford to rent alone. As with many budget decisions, it's a personal choice and a hard one: grit your teeth and carry on living with housemates, or curtail your saving potential and live alone.

Have you considered renting a two-bed and letting out the 2nd room occasionally to keep the cost down? Might give a bit more flexibility. "

Wheeler did a surprisingly good job.
Yep. Posted this after about 10 minutes of reviewing the stats for the first time. Definitely eye opening and am adjusting certain aspects of my strategy. 
"&gt;The charts you showed to me look pretty reasonable. For how much risk pharma companies take on, it's natural to have higher profit margins during successful years.

The fact that they continuously have profit margins like this seems to indicate that they're primarily in the business of making obscene profits.

&gt;Unlike car companies, if you don't regularly have lucky breakthroughs you're going to go bust.

You're implying that car makers don't have reason to innovate or depend on continuous R&amp;D providing breakthroughs that give them an edge in an incredibly competitive market.

I suppose that the year 2008 is too far in the distant past to remember.

&gt;Banks are right up next to pharma in profit, and they're not literally saving people's lives

There are many sectors and professions out there that save people's lives. The fact that we don't compensate firefighters in the same way the pharma industry is being compensated demonstrates that this isn't about saving people's lives. It's about an industry that exploits a polypolistic market position to the absolute maximum degree.

The fact that banks **also** make unjustifiable obscene profits isn't exactly an argument in favor of the pharmaceutical industry.

&gt;Regardless, you should blame the government for creating the game that the pharma companies are playing

And you should probably not move the goalposts."

"Another courageous person that saw the light/truth is former Sheriff [Richard Mack](https://sheriffrichardmack.com/)

&gt; Sheriff Mack is best known for challenging the Brady Bill, a gun control scheme requiring local law enforcement to perform background checks on prospective gun purchasers. He maintained that the Federal Government had no authority to command local officials, and became the first sheriff in American history to sue the Federal Government (under the Clinton administration) and win at the US Supreme Court. The case was based on the Tenth Amendment, states rights and local sovereignty.

"That's the definition post commonly used, yes. However, I'm seeing a disconnect between that and your comments. You say you don't believe in a higher power, but you don't consider yourself an atheist. Why is that?

I don't disagree with your statement that there's a possibility that some higher power exists. I'm an atheist, because even though I admit there might be a possibility of a deity, I don't hold a belief in any deities. Did I misunderstand? If so, what deity do you believe in?

An atheist is a person who does not believe in deities. A theist is a person who believes in deities. If you are not a theist, then you are an atheist. If you are not an atheist, then you are a theist. The words form a binary complement - much like a/symmetrical."

"I work in the industry and I just gotta say you’re quite wrong about it not being competitive. In most of the country it’s more expensive to burn coal, so it just sits there unburned. By the time renewables take over completely in 5-10 years, you will have already missed out on the profit opportunity! Most of these companies are way under their ATHs, yet have better tech, better business models, and greater market penetration than ever. Looks like a buying opportunity to me! However, I respect your opinion, and we will just have to see who’s right in 10 years

From my vantage point, it seems like renewables are becoming economical and unavoidable for mainstream companies. NEE has 15 GW of wind and solar, AES just announced a strategy transition towards renewables, California utilities are forced to be renewable to hit aggressive public policy mandates by 2030. BMW, F, and GM (amongst many others) all highlighted electric vehicles as key parts of their strategy going forward in their annual reports.

This is only in addition to small companies like FSLR, ENPH, RUN, etc who are more directly tied to the industry and are in a position for potential of explosive growth"

"I think your view of sheet-masking is a bit skewed? It is entirely okay and practiced by many to wipe off their sheet mask essence. Why? Because the essence is not the main benefit in sheet-masking, keeping your skin damp for an extended period time is. Excessive essence actually clogged pore and cause breakout for many. Plus sheet mask essence isn't that precious because they are diluted ""serum"". They are just water + butylene gylcol and minimal beneficial ingredient. Some people do well with leaving the essence on, some actually benefit by wiping off the essence and then apply whatever they needed for their skin concern.  After dampen, skin is more perceptive to whatever is put on. I wouldn't say ""improve absorption"" because skin is pretty good at keeping things out, but dry skin is even better at keeping things out than dampened skin. Sheet masking work on the same principle as the 5-layer cotton popularized by Saeki Chizu where you dampen cotton with water and a little bit of serum. "

"First off - thanks for the good reply.

1 - I agree that useless evaluation serve no purpose - I disagree these evaluations are useless.
2 - Poorly conducted evaluations is a significant concern; I do not feel removing them is the solution to the problem. As you cited that under-confidence is a issue many youth face. I think overconfidence can also be dangerous - especially when you are engineering a student to fail later on rather then dealing with the problem when it is manageable rather then many years of costly job retraining or worse. I think of many of the ""How did you not learn this in school"" moments I have with new hires and the slowing down of everyone's work because we are now trying to get someone up to speed who believed they were a rockstar rather then simply being told they were wrong - they feel worse because now they look like a fool.

How do we combat illiteracy is a fair question - as you highlighted above part of the problem is...how do you have that conversation? People love to be supremely confident in their abilities and testing tends to give a fairly objective guideline to address that - As you mentioned moral is a issue but unfortunately challenges can be failed or else they would not be challenges - and I feel it would be a diservice to youth to disguise rote process as a challenge with no actual measure of success. Just as those tests might force a student to give up on their education - if that is a indicator of that persons resolve then they may just well give up on many other challenges in life.

I don't want to just say ""Life isn't fair"" so I guess the easy way to say it is ""Life is objective"""
"Great idea. If you've got marketing down and have production down you've pretty much nailed it, there isn't much else that goes into event production. Definitely create your own website, as you're targeting a niche audience it will help you build a reputation. Maybe try to get some local news coverage, but that probably won't come until after your first successful event. 

As for licenses, that depends on your jurisdiction. If you're planning to rent an established event space and hire a catering company for drink service, they'll probably have the licensing taken care of already. Otherwise, in most US states you'd be required to get some form of temporary occupancy permit for the venue and temporary liquor license. If you're going full DIY make sure you do the research here!"

It’s worth noting that you don’t really know the extent of these issues since most of the time the inspector just said “contact licensed contractor/ electrician to evaluate.” There easily could be 10,000 worth of repairs by the time everything is fixed.

With our current system the Conservative Party could get taken over by a far right extremist figure who could then go on to win government with less than 40&amp;#37; of the vote. We're seeing shades of it in the Ontario election right now.

I think the biggest thing we could do to avoid US style politics is to move our electoral system away from a US style system and towards one of the countries with healthier democracies, like New Zealand or Germany."

"If it someone I know, I'll just smile and knod. It's not worth getting into a heated argument. I'll also ask them to explain certain points that I know to be easily debunked and occasionally will say things like, ""thats interesting, can you send me a source for that so I can read up on it on my own?""

If I'm just walking down the street and theres a religious person handing out pamphlets, I've found that they'll usually respond to my ""no thanks"" with ""god bless"". So I throw up the horns and reply hail satan. But only if they say ""god bless"" or something to that effect. If you're going to push your beliefs on me in public, then I'm throwing it right back at them.

If they're missionaries knocking on my door, I take control of the conversation. you're on my turf and you're going to play by my rules. I'll question them about sexual abuses in the church, about basic things like the implausibility of god's omnipotence, about their religion's definition of god has changed as science has filled in the gaps, etc.  

Your beliefs are private. Hell, even jesus supposedly said that faith is best practiced in your own home. So they're breaking their own rules by bothering me with it. Also, I believe that by making them aware of belief systems outside their own, that their sect isn't the norm. The more of us that respond confidently to the missionaries that we're atheists, the more normal it becomes. There are parallels with the gay community and how normalization of it caused groups in opposition to eventually accept it. Maybe as more people become aware of the athiests in their midst, they'll stop judging, and they'll also more critically evaluate their own faith."

I also remember this place from my childhood nearby my house where you could see down into a little valley from only a very certain viewpoint on a hill and hidden down there, among the trees, was the most beautiful little clearing with a small orchard in it. I remember thinking that must be what the garden of Eden looked like, or Shangri-La, or some equivalent. I would love to do something similar in the future!

"You seem either sadly misinformed or in despair over your losses. Here’s a paste from an excellent post by /u/cyclicamp, down below. Ever heard of Hemmingway’s “slowly at first, and then suddenly?” That’s not manipulation. It’s a cascade effect.

tl;dr - short squeeze

People had positions where they bet on BTC to go down in price, called a short position.  To do this, you borrow someone else's BTC, sell it, and buy it back at a lower price.  However, they expect you to pay back the BTC regardless of what actually happens.  

If BTC got too high you could never afford to buy it back with what's in your account, so there's a threshold where the system will automatically close your position/buy BTC before that happens in order to make the lender whole.  Usually this threshold is some percentage of your overall account.  You typically can't short unless you have other assets.

When a lot of people are shorting like this, a cascade can happen.  When the price gets too high, people will have their positions closed for them and BTC will be purchased automatically with their accounts.  Of course, with the buy, the price gets higher.  This causes more short positions to be closed, causing a higher price, and on and on.

If you're not paying attention, the price can get very high and wipe out a large amount of your account.  It's brutal and savage, and people get rekt.

Exchanges aren’t manipulating the price in this particular case. That’s not how it works. Marketmakers contracted to the exchange CONTROL the price. And guess what - That’s not manipulation in the least sense of the word! Regardless of your share of the pie, you are just as rightfully entitled to control the price of the asset. Why is it okay for a small plankton to move btc by a factor of 0.1% and a big whale is arbitrarily not allowed to move it proportionally without screams of “manipulation” from the ignorant and despaired?"

"SLS is the only launch vehicle for Orion right now.

The current plan for the first SLS mission - named EM-1 - is to fly the Orion capsule with no crew into a lunar orbit. It is scheduled for NET (no earlier than) Dec 15, 2019, but it's not clear if they will meet that milestone.

That is flying what is known as ""block 1"" of SLS; it has the main booster but a smaller ""interim"" upper stage. 

The next mission is EM-2, which would fly the same vehicle configuration with a crew of 4 on a flyby around the moon. That is currently scheduled for June of 2022, and then EM-3 is planned for 2024.

The big gaps in the schedule are because SLS is so expensive and they can't afford to fly more often, but it's very frustrating.

"&gt; The bottom line is that the province does not have access to any surplus funds it contributes to the pension plan. Since it cannot access the funds, it cannot call them an asset.

It can access them, there is an agreement in place which dictates how to use a surplus to draw down future contributions. The Auditor was basically saying ""okay then, until you do that it's not an asset."" But that they have it available to them should be enough.

&gt; The government does not record a liability for the total amount it expects to pay out in pensions.

"Economics professors are far from experts; they are pseudoscientists. 

If you were referring to actual economics experts employed in the finance industry; I may listen to you. Economics professors are wrong more times than meteorologists. Very few have experience working outside a university.

&gt;Unlike engineers and chemists, economists cannot point to concrete objects – cell phones, plastic – to justify the high valuation of their discipline. Nor, in the case of financial economics and macroeconomics, can they point to the predictive power of their theories. Hedge funds employ cutting-edge economists who command princely fees, but routinely underperform index funds. Eight years ago, Warren Buffet made a 10-year, $1 million bet that a portfolio of hedge funds would lose to the S&amp;P 500, and it looks like he’s going to collect. In 1998, a fund that boasted two Nobel Laureates as advisors collapsed, nearly causing a global financial crisis.

"I abuse oils, but I've already listed those for you. I focus on high lineoleic oils, as those are less likely to cause breakouts/clogs.

Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion Moist is my soul mate. The Premium version is fine, but I prefer watery toners. Shirojyun Lotion is also fine. I also use/have used Cezanne High Moist, Kiku High Moist, and Klairs Supple Prep (I want to try the unscented version). I don't think any of those gave me trouble, but it's so hard to be sure.

COSRX Galactomyces Essence and Snail 96 Essence are staples. Both are very hydrating. I also use Benton Snail Bee Essence (I'm on my last bottle of the old formula and I have 4 bottles of the new formula). I just added the COSRX AHA Power Liquid and the BHA Power Liquid to try to get my clogs to go away.

I have recently started using Sulwhasoo products. First Care Activating Serum, Capsulized Ginseng Serum, Snowise Brightening Serum, and Lumi Essential Finisher. I really like the first two (dat earthy smell, tho &lt;3). 

I use Mizon Snail Recovery Gel, A'Pieu Madecassoside Cream, and Rosette Ceramide Gel as occlusives. I see nothing wrong with the Mizon, not sure if the A'Pieu does anything for me, and *pretty* sure the Rosette doesn't break me out.

I use eye creams with or without fatty alcohols, as my eye area doesn't seem to care about those. My favorite is Sulwhasoo Ginseng Eye Cream.

To sum it up: You will have to pry Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion Moist, Cezanne or Kiku High Moist, COSRX Galactic Mice, and COSRX 96 Snails out of my cold, dead, well-hydrated hands. Most other things I am happy with, but not 100% positive they are necessary."

The system was designed by free masons. They created the American system to be very well balanced.

The American system is unique because it's (supposed) to be run by the people, for the people. The people are supposed to make sure their government doesn't go tyrannical, according to the constitution. *I can't imagine the powerful feeling to inclined to listen to their people if they didn't have teeth*. It's in some's best interest if the *People* were on as many meds as possible chasing butterflies, in which this case, the People have failed miserably.

"I get where you're coming from and I don't envy people in your position at all. There will always be problems when any new set of rules comes in, but I'd much rather that than the alternative of never changing the regulations, particularly in areas that are changing as fast as technology is.

I agree that that chances of, particularly the current, US government passing meaningful legislation on the matter are somewhat slim. The GDPR was largely a unification of existing privacy laws, like the data protection act we've had in Britain (where I live) for the past 20 years, and even so it took 4 years of beaucracy to hammer it out. Seeing as the US doesn't have much in the way data protection regulation to start with, I guess we've just got to hope that self-regulation works out. But that doesn't mean that it's in any way the ideal solution.

I do think though, and this is just my personal opinion, if I'm dealing with a company like Google or Facebook or whoever else, my contact information should never end up in the private address book of one of their employees with no oversight from the company's management, let alone the authorities. Maybe in your specific company it's more acceptable but either way it might be worth just getting your employees to put their business contacts is an app that allows for a little more oversight."

For example, the ""Aerospace &amp; Defense"" Expert Pie resembles the iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF  ($ITA).  The Expert Pie has the same top six stocks as the ETF, but the ETF has 38 holdings instead of 6.

Question is, would the top 6 holdings, which make up a majority of the ETF portfolio, provide better or worse return than owning the ETF?

Would it cost M1 less if I owned the ETF (one trade per deposit) instead of the Expert Pie (six trades per deposit)."

"""Maximizing the social status of white people"" is as legitimate of a goal as any other (in fact ""maximizing the status of my social group"" has been a value held by most humans since forever)
It's at odds with my personal values, probably because one of my parents isn't white and because I'm a younger person in an American city, where that value is not encouraged. But there is no objectively ""right"" value.

&gt;Are you saying that your personal experiences make you feel insecure about your ability to provide for yourself?

Sometimes I am insecure about my ability to provide for myself. Realistically, I'm probably going to be fine in today's economy given my social class, occupation, etc. But there are no guarantees, and things are a lot more precarious for a huge swath of humanity. I hate feeling like my situation is precarious, and seeing other people feel that makes me feel bad.

In my utopian ideal, the laziest, most parasitic member of society would be guaranteed happiness and economic security at an equal level to everyone else, by force if necessary.

&gt; It seems like you’re taking government efficiency for granted. Why does government intervention in the private sector guarantee equality of outcome?

Yes. Maybe some handwavey argument about computers in charge of everything could result in optimal efficiency. The ""private sector"" necessarily involves conflicting goals and incomplete information, which must mean that some inefficiency and risk is introduced. Theoretically, shouldn't having one unified goal and complete information maximize efficiency and minimize risk?"

"Sure seems like the original Facebook post, and headlines from other articles, are trying to give this assignment the benefit of the doubt by assuming it was intended to weigh the pros and cons of the system of enslaving people, while the assignment itself seems to indicate that this was aimed at weighing it from ""The Life of Slaves"". It would be problematic enough under the best possible interpretation of the assignment without showing specific context. It would still probably be a shitty assignment if you were specifically asking students to consider why people thought slavery was a good idea or how they rationalized it, without including primary sources attempting to justify slavery as being some sort of profitable form of missionary work, as was often the case for such justifications.

It’s certainly one of the biggest cultural differences between the two countries. 

As for the nursing homes themselves, I can’t speak to what they were like because I don’t know and I don’t want to insult what I’m sure are some great people who work there, but abuses were common according to my friend.

I realize it's outlandish mystical bullshit, and I don't believe in it whatsoever, but for me it really drove home the point that living beings don't choose where we are born, what we are, what we look like, and the experiences we go through, and at least in ways that are PRACTICAL, it makes me want to reach out and work to alleviate all negative experiences from any living being, whether it's a bug, fish, lizard, farm animal, or human. This incredible gift of life that we have is SO short, so fleeting, and it's our only chance for self-realizing conscious existence, I believe that all living things should have a chance at happiness and contentment while here. But I also realize that only my choices and decisions are ones I have any influence over, I can't and I don't want to make choices for other people, that is their path to walk"

If you are invaded by a hostile force and they lose, what do you think normally happens in the world?  They get the boot.  He is not calling for genocide and he's making an argument for it based on their hostile actions.  If this is why you call him a Nazi then you have an extremely low bar.

Granted I don't always agree with everything Israel does but it's an argument being made that has a ton of precedent and if they had not been an invading force with the very intent of wiping out every last Jew then I might be more sympathetic but come on.

I get that people hate Jews or Israel or both, fine that's your right but this is a philosophical argument.   Look at Germany after WWI and WW2 for that matter. That's what happens to nations that lose.  Germany I believe like the coalition against Israel was a special case.

"All right let’s assume the best case scenario for the police, in that scenario a woman was arrested not put under any sort of surveillance with a history of mental illness and allowed access to an item to commit bodily harm. Then when the police discovered her body they waited an inordinate amount of time before notifying anyone that someone died on their watch. In that situation her death is still at their feet."

" I'm a Realtor and this is exactly how I purchased my fourplex. I had searched my area but unfortunately no properties looked good. So starting from the best properties to worst ones, I sent out a mailer explaining my situation and that I would like to purchase their property. A few reached out, we tried negotiations however we weren't align with price, until I found the one I currently own. Your next step is to speak with a Realtor.  You want to make sure you are represented with your own Realtor. That is what the seller did, (I only represented myself in purchase) that way you can trust the transaction is going smoothly. Good Luck and have a Great Day!"

"Well, likewise “mass shootings” are extremely rare but get massively publicized in the media. Something like less than .1% of firearm deaths can be attributed to mass shooting. 10 times as many people die from alcohol and tobacco than firearms; 20 times more people die from cancer and about the same for heart disease. Obesity and diabetes are far more pressing and affect more people. Firearm fatalities are about the same as traffic fatalities and it’s largely suicide.

"Neither is alcohol. People make it seem like drinking and driving is guaranteed to get you arrested or into an accident, but the actual rate of consequences for a single incident of drinking and driving at the legal limit for intoxication is around 1%. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that most people who try meth either do it once and never again, or that they manage some kind of occasional, recreational use that does not interfere with their lives.

The error in thinking ""behavior X isn't as bad as most people believe"", whether X is drinking and driving, or smoking meth, or something along those lines, is that other people's ridiculously exaggerated claims won't protect you from whatever real consequences may result from behavior X.

You wouldn't play Russian roulette with a 100 chamber revolver for one night of feeling good. For the same reason, it's not a good idea to roll the dice by drinking and driving or trying meth, even if there is only a 1% chance of something going wrong.

"IMO, not having roommates at that age is just silly. You're throwing away money, and I think those year's are actually crucial for learning to be a decent person to live with. It's super easy imo to find a place for ~$1000/mo with roommates, in a desirable neighborhood with a decent commute (Williamsburg, E. Williamsburg, Greenpoint, parts of Bushwick, Clinton Hill, Fort Green, Prospect Heights, Crown Heights, etc. Even in Manhattan the UES, Harlem, and Murray Hill areas all have availability in that range.  

If $1000/month is way out of your price range, then you're definitely gonna need to look farther out than those neighborhoods, but it's still not impossible.

"Here's a fun fact that will explode Trump supporters' minds. If you go back to that very first speech he gave, that one way back at the beginning of all this where he descended from a golden escalator, and you search for the word 'undocumented' or 'illegal', you will find that Trump said either of those words exactly zero times. Yep, guess what? Your number one talking point that Trump is only referring to illegal immigrants who break the law is a complete lie. Trump has always been against immigration, pure and simple, and it's only that he dislikes (more realistically hates) illegal immigrants the most. Even though America is literally a nation of immigrants. Screw that guy."

He lies on agreements he signs (e.g. ""the bitcoin.com pool will mine with NYA/btc1/2x code... whoops just kidding, we're mining bcash instead""). He even had the audacity to lie about what happened in court, when there is a public transcript available which disproves everything he said.

What you see is a push. First it could be 10k, then 5k, maybe 1k in a decade. Then it will be 100 eventually. Then they start adding taxes, and interest based on everything you buy to discourage you. Then you will be paying five dollars extra for a cup of shitty coffee.

It seems like the act should fall under loaning a gun and thus not needing a background check but the transfer of money for the rental seems to make it a temporary ""sale"" since it is not a transfer between private parties but between a business and a customer. 


While NICS in its current state is not designed for it, this could provide a push for private party access to NICS that would allow for a check in this scenario in a simpler and faster way using the temporary unique identification number concept that has been proposed.

"&gt; Could the court really have made a more practical ruling than it has without effectively changing the constitution?

First, the Supreme Court *has* changed the constitution before when they ""read in"" sexual orientation as a prohibited grounds of discrimination.  That simply wasn't there before and the Supreme Court decided to put it in.  Good decision, many would argue and rather importantly, it fit with the changing social mores and mood of the time, so we're all quite happy with the result.  (Doing the same thing in December 1982 would have not gone over quite as well, and doing it in 1950 if we pretend the Charter existed then, would have gone over *very* badly.)   But good decision aside, let's not pretend it wasn't a change.  It was a change, the Supreme Court made it and our society as a whole was very quickly quite happy with this change.

But to your point, I think Mr. Coyne's point is that the court's ruling changes the constitution by endorsing the myriad ways the provinces have been violating the constitution and that a different ruling would have upheld the constitution.    

Indeed, it does take some mental gymnastics to say that the words ""*All Articles of the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces*"" actually means that provinces may block the entry of goods from one province to another.

Or more succinctly, it's ridiculous that the Supreme Court just ""decided that the words ""admitted free"" actually mean ""doesn't have to be admitted"".

***************
Now the Court is absolutely right that provinces have been doing this for ages and that to actually recognize that ""admitted free"" means what those words actually mean in English would upend the long history of provinces blocking the free admittance of another province's goods.

But it's interesting that rather than say ""yeah, you've all been violating the obvious meaning of the constitution so stop doing it"", the court has instead endorsed those violations and insisted they're not violations at all.

Once the keys are collected and verified (which can be done in stealth) the attacker will write a script to send these addresses enough ETH for a couple of transactions. Then the very same script should drain all collected keys of any valuables.

* (Choose an audience you can serve with your skills, knowledge, interests)

"I had a chance to tour SpaceX's campus in Los Angeles recently...

You know those old World War 2 photos of bomber assembly lines?

That's what they have.  Only it's rockets, not bombers.  And the assembly line is full of high tech shit, not just nuts and bolts and power tools.

The building looks big from the outside but once you get inside and see how they have packed so much productivity into every single square inch, it's actually a little shocking.

Even a layperson who looks around can tell that *some*body in there, high up in the chain of command, knows what they're doing.  Clusterfucks don't have that kind of organization or efficient use of space.

And, more likely, **everyone** there knows what they're doing.

After the tour I was eating at a restaurant just outside this building (which is also made and staffed by SpaceX, or at least by Elon Musk, it might be under a different company), and as I was eating I literally sat there and watched two helicopters and a private jet land just outside the restaurant window at the private airstrip they own next door.

These people are fucking **busy**.  It's not all just marketing and smoke and mirrors, they're getting a lot of shit done.

"It's clear that if Sessions doesn't fire Rosenstein, then Trump will fire them both.  Trump is steaming mad that Rosenstein is allowing the Mueller probe to delve into every aspect of his life and that of his associates - ignoring the role of the Special Counsel to look into ""collusion with Russian meddling"".  Allowing a Special Counsel to turn over every stone in a person's past could destroy or cripple anyone less pure than Mr. Rogers, and should be impermissible.  This is what happened with the despicable Ken Starr probe of Clinton, and I deplored that witch hunt then, just as I deplore Mueller's overreach now.  If Sessions doesn't get this message and remove Rosenstein or at least put him on a strict leash, they are both gone.  Trump has had enough, and the Dems and the Resisters in the streets can fume and protest all they like.  Trump is President and Republicans control the government.  And I don't blame him a second for being irate as hell about the Deep State vendetta he's been subjected to.

Whereas Trump will NOT fire Mueller.  He knows that many congressional Republicans would construe this as obstruction of justice.  His interests are best served by allowing Mueller's probe to continue, but under the supervision of a DOJ official who will insure that the probe keeps to its stated purpose.   "

&gt; You think they were too stupid to understand Labour policy on an issue Labour had been perfectly clear about. Sounds like contempt to me.

That's not what I think at all... I said I don't agree with voting Labour if you're a remainer but that I understood why you would. Given the opposition in his own party, the 3 line whip and his own stance in the customs union, I think it's unfair to call their policy 'perfectly clear'

I think the FT put it best when they wrote 

&gt;Until now, Labour’s position on Brexit has been confused. Mr Corbyn is an anti-EU politician at heart, regarding the bloc as a capitalist club. His MPs, meanwhile, are committed Remainers. Working out what Labour’s Brexit policy means has never been a happy task.

The difference in outcomes between an RRSP and TFSA can be huge when not a big pot ends up being saved by retirement.  This is true even if you would be contributing to the RRSP at a high marginal tax bracket.  The difference can easily be waaaaay more than the 25% that the company plan gives you.     

Concentrate on creating an emergency fund, using a TFSA to hold it.  Then add additional long term savings also to the TFSA."

&gt;Greece, for example, has far more wealth than their debt. But has that helped them?

Here we start falling into into the counterfactual problem: what if Greece had been Venezuela? Maybe they'd still be in crisis mode? The US has long been number one in both GDP and National Wealth- that didn't prevent the US in 2007-8 crisis (but it did give the U.S. more power to recover as FDI kept flowing in during the crisis). No single number can capture the political economies of countries: things like allies, trade deals, stable governments, membership of custom unions, risk of contagion, allies, hegemony, and voice in international institutions all matter for economies in crisis."
"Not tax and spend really just means ""tax your grandkids and spend"". 

Though if the debt interest rate is lower than inflation, technically the government makes money by carrying debt. After the financial crisis, people were buying bonds with negative yeilds (literally paying the government to hold money). 

As long as the money spend by the government results in economic growth that returns higher tax money at a rate above the debt interest rate minus inflation, I don't see why you wouldn't borrow to ~~sour~~ *spur* growth. Any smart company would invest if they could get 'cheap' loans and had guaranteed returns. Think science and education investment. The returns are quite good. 

Republicans know that the debt doesn't matter _yet_, so they can cut taxes when in power to make people happy, then when out of power they rail against ""socialist"" Democrats all they want. Long term, we can't let the debt get too high. But like I said, right now the government basically makes money as long as spending is reasonably smart. Time will tell if the tax cuts work out that way. Perhaps the corporate rate cut will pay for itself, but the personal tax cuts will be harder to sort out since the people getting the most money are already rich. "

"It lowers prices of consumer goods but also removes labor pressure pushing wages up. I’m actually not passing judgement on the practice specifically.

"For a first attempt at a closed life support system, it was pretty good.  They achieved 99% closure.  There were two problems they didn't think of:  Mt Pinatubo erupting, and lowering solar flux by putting dust in the upper atmosphere, and carbonation of concrete used in construction.  The latter removed CO2 from the environment, which means the plants didn't have as much to work with.  There was also one design flaw: not enough design margin for supporting the people.  As a consequence, the bionauts were slightly food and oxygen deficient.  They lost weight and didn't have the energy to do all the manual tasks.

A new attempt at a fully closed life support system could fix all those problems, and there is **no need** to be 100% closed in space.  For example, the Martian atmosphere is 96% CO2, 2% nitrogen, and 2% argon.  You can easily replenish an Earth-like atmosphere from that (78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon). "

Through the return to the land to which they were bound by close historic ties...Jews sought to abolish their pariah status among peoples... The advent of Hitler underscored with a savage logic all the disastrous implications contained in the abnormal situation in which Jews found themselves. Millions of Jews perished... because there was no spot on the globe where they could find sanctuary...The Jewish survivors demand the right to dwell amid brothers, on the ancient soil of their fathers.""Letter to Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, June 13, 1947[20]

"&gt;They are not. If you disagree, quote how KM arrived at these figures:

See appendix 4, after you read all three sections. They detail how they calculate it, the assumptions they make and the way they reach their conclusions. They have also included their analysis of spills. In short, they have taken all of the incidents which have caused spills previously. Calculated rates on them, identified the areas that they could occur and the frequencies of those occurrences and then put those all together to come up with an overall risk ranking. 

&gt;Table 34 on page 47 of the pdf shows a worst credible case chance per year of 0.219%.

No, only if they don't engage in activities such as extended tug operations. 

&gt;The chance of an event with probability p happening at least once in n tries is 1 - (1 - p)n

Again no, that assumes independence between an event happening year to year. That is not the case. This is not flipping a coin where one toss does not affect the others. Rather, there are dependent variables such as culture, training and maintenance which serve to make the formula dependent on itself. 

&gt;That gives us a 10.3% chance of at least one worst case spill in 50 years that we won't be able to fully clean up regardless of how much money we throw at it.

Except the risk mitigation procedures are able to be put in place. Which even ignoring the independence, and the overestimates identified in the report, and ignoring the risk reductions which occur over time, and ignoring the improvements to the quality of the ships we're at 2%.

But lets actually consider the report, you know the parts that you said they didn't include (apparently all of that text is meaningless), that their model overestimates the chance of grounding by 5x, because only 20% of power losses are sudden and no choice (model takes the event and assumes all of them are sudden) or that there are often tugs available to assist.

Well either you are very smart, and really don't know how smart you are or you are really stupid and don't know how smart some other people are. 

I happy to acknowledge that anyone who applies themselves can attain a certain level of mastery at something, but for one thing even finding someone who is able to apply that level of dedication, when the thing they used to be passionate about has become, repetitive, back-breaking, or eating into other areas their life; well that person is a rarer breed than most. 

Then there are indeed the brilliant stars. Those people that make the same contribution as 10 average people or 100 or more. They exist, they make a massive difference. Like some of the corporate leaders I work with know the minutest details of hundreds of projects spread across dozens of countries. They literally pack their days with meeting one team after another, marketing, engineering, strategy and adsorbing and directing everything for the next 6 months, before flying out to the next country or regional centre the following week. But ask them anything and they will know each detail backwards. 

Sure you can reach mastery, but if you haven't reached it in something already, or are not well on the way then you probably never will. This bullshit that ""I could if I worked hard enough"" is utter crap because you probably don't have the powers of concentration and application to work that hard anyway.

"You can't get married and then buy a home together in which one of you is not an eligible first time home buyer, AND receive first time home buyer benefits. If one partner is ineligible both are ineligible.

**Option 1:** Buy the home outright in your name, then get married.

**Why**- to be eligible for first time home buyer

**Why not** - you may not be able to afford it on your income alone. You both go into marriage with your own assets, and if you get divorced you get those back, but everything earned during the marriage is split. The exception being the Matrimonial home. So since you would be using all your cash on the home, you would be left with half of what you have in the case of divorce.

**Option 2:** You jointly buy the house.

**Why** - see reasons of why not above

**Why not - not eligible for first time home buyer

**Accountant's point of view** If your partner gets auditted by CRA, he will be screwed since either a) he is not reporting the investment income. (if he is reporting it then...) b) this isn't a princiapal residence eligible for the exemption. Unless he filed a specific form 3 years ago.

&gt; Why are you so keen on military intervention? Because that's worked out great over the last thirty or so years, yes?

Did non-intervention work the last time Assad did this? It did not. And what track record does non-intervention have? The Congo Wars might not have got much media attention on account of our non-intervention, but they still managed to kill six million people.

Intervention is only more obvious when it fails, but apathy has a history just as chequered.

I don't claim any special knowledge; their interests are public knowledge. Russia has wanted a port on the Mediterranean for literally centuries, and Syria provides one. And the dynamics of dictatorships are well understood - particularly those dependent on outside aid like Assad's or natural resources like Putin's.

There is no special insight required to see that there's not much Russia can negotiate for on this issue - unless we're willing to concede on some other issue like the economic sanctions over Ukraine or the Skirpal assassination attempt. It doesn't take special insight to see that we have no reason to do that either."

"I'm not an expert on classical liberalism so I looked it up. This is the first sentence from the first link that Google gave me:

""...private property, an unhampered market economy..."". I would say that classical liberalism would consider fascism and communism to be diametrically opposed on these key areas, therefore there is a great deal of difference between fascism and communism in the eyes of a classical liberal. Now I'm not sure what fascism has to say about freedom of religion, though I believe that fascist governments generally have opposed religions other than the majority, but communism as a doctrine is steadfastly irreligious, and communist states have traditionally pushed atheism hard on the people."

I don't think either the First or Second Amendments were enacted only for the purposes of preventing/stopping a tyrannical government. That might be the extreme end of those Amendments, but they have many uses before they become that extreme. In any event, First Amendment case law is much broader than just protecting citizens' speech from acts of Congress or protecting political speech in general. Things like video games (Brown v. ESA), topless dancing (City of Erie v. Pap's), issuing trademarks (Matal v. Tam) protection from civil suit (Snyder v. Phelps), and from being punished by a public university (Healy v.

I imagine the stations would have long stretches of support structure along the cable in order to spread out their weight and the weight of the tether across as much cable as possible.

Take myself instance.  Obviously an anecdote but I know I'm not the only one who posts here.  I am a socialist.  Technically, a libsoc.  Merits of my personal political philosophy aside there are going to be things I disagree with Bernie on.  I consider him too right wing and too liberal to truly represent my beliefs.  Nevertheless I would support him in an election, as I did during the primary, as he is probably as close to my politics as possible.

It doesn't take a PhD in rocket appliances to see see he was cheated to some degree.  The media was definitely biased against him.  It is an irrefutable fact that the media reported superdelegate votes in vote totals in their reporting, votes that did not exist yet.  Even ex\-coms director for the DNC [Luis Miranda said this was not kosher](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/king-clinton-media-counting-superdelegates-dnc-pleas-article-1.2655752), yet acknowledged this bias existed.  Was the bias to the level some here suggest? Probably not.  But the scales were tilted.

But in order to not ramble, to get to the point I will disagree with Bernie on some policy issues.  I will also disagree with some of his statements, some of his stances.  But I don't think the overwhelming majority of posters here actually bash ""everything he says"" nor take ""the opposite sides of his"".  I think you are being hyperbolic."

"The first two years of her life, she spent with her birth mother. This woman... Ooh, it still makes me mad. This woman's idea of raising a child was to stick it in a car seat for hours on end, even if they weren't actually going anywhere. When we would get her on the weekends, she would be absolutely filthy. And I'm not talking your average, grubby little baby, I mean, this child STUNK. Her hair would be matted. Her diaper would be falling off of her, it was so full. The poor kid kept a yeast infection from the filth for damn near 6 months. We only got her every other weekend, and sometimes wouldn't get her at all for a month because her mom would make up excuses. ""Oh well she's sick, I really don't want her to leave."" ""I don't have the gas money to meet you in town, and you're not allowed on the property here so you can't come get her.""

This poor baby.. she was always hungry. You could tell her birth mother didn't feed her regularly. At a year and a half old, she would wait until after dinner and go to the garbage can looking for scraps that had been thrown out. She would look under the couch and if she happened to find anything edible under it, you would have to fight her to keep her from eating it. 

You could tell she was used to being screamed at, too. If you told her ""Vanna, no-no, don't do that,"" she would freak out and start crying and run to a corner and just try to be as small as possible, while holding her ears and crying silently...

"Ugh. The government seriously needs to start thinking in terms of Agile. These problems would have become apparent if the government got their hands on the software earlier in the development process. It's always more manageable to fix problems early.

Defining a lengthy set of requirements up-front then leaving the developer alone until it's done is a recipe for disaster. I've worked on big software projects and in my experience it's almost impossible to get requirements right before you actually start using the software. It's easy to miss things, not think situations through, or find that what you thought you wanted isn't actually very good."

I use common law to refer to law created by courts and inherited by our judicial system (from England).  And case law to refer to precedential decisions by a court of jurisdiction. 

The point is that case law is meant to guide the law within the boundaries of statutes. And case law has no precedential value against legislation. 

With the exception of constitutional case law. But that just requires constitutional legislation. 

For example, the California Supreme Court ruled that the California Constitution protected the rights of gays to get married. Then the people of California promptly amended their constitution to say “gays can’t get married” and viola... homophobia reigned supreme. "

"If the vote is based on the popular vote and the electoral college shifts to reflect that popular vote, it's essentially removing the electoral college and replacing it with as close to a ""one person one vote"" system as you can get. The decision to change the electoral college votes is to remove the electoral college in the event that a presidential candidate would win without having the popular vote. That is the only time that it would actually matter.

Essentially, the compact goes like this,

Candidate A wins popular vote, but Candidate B wins electoral college.

State A voted for Candidate A. Nothing happens as the state is already in line with the popular vote.

State B voted for Candidate B. The vote will change to Candidate A to reflect the popular vote.

The purpose of this is not to change peoples' votes (if that was a concern, the current system already does that in every situation due to the winner takes all system) as much as to remove the electoral college's ability to override the popular vote in determining the presidential candidate. The electoral college right now allows for one person to just straight up EDIT: *ignore* thousands, if not tens of thousands, of votes and just do whatever they want personally. While most of the electors vote according to the popular vote at the local level, some of them do not.

The second problem people see with the electoral college is that it is not a ""one person one vote"" system. A vote from a smaller pop state is always going to be worth more than a vote from a large pop state due to the way the electoral votes are counted.

In the end, this system is a truer version of the ""one person one vote"" because it's trying to get rid of the situations where the electoral college can bypass the popular vote."

"Sorry, missed that critical bit!

OK, the amount you need to pay in is (54000-46,351)=7649. to _just_ get out of 40% tax, but don't forget you'll need to allow for any pay rise over the year. When you say:

&gt;Both work on qualifying earnings.

Can you expand on what that means? Are you saying you've got to specify your contribution as a % of (46350-6032)=40318? That seems really odd, as you can make pension contributions of over 40000 a year in some circumstances and has someone really designed a system where you can enter a contribution of &gt;100% ?

Presuming you've got to specify your contribution as a % of (46350-6032), then you're looking at (7649/40318)x100=18.97%.

As nobody else has posted - with regard to your second question, I think you're going to have to talk to the appropriate staff with your employer. You also need to look at what is actually going on inside each pension i.e. investment decisions and fee structures etc. https://thepeoplespension.co.uk/investments/investment-options/investment-funds/ looks like a good starting point for the people's pension, as you can evaluate your risk profile to equity levels."

&gt; WASHINGTON] Ratings agency S&amp;P said Tuesday it cut the rating on Turkey&amp;#039;s foreign debt due to deteriorating finances and rising inflation.

&gt; Turkey recorded stellar growth of 7.4 per cent in 2017 but the data have failed to douse fears over the underlying health of the economy which is marked by double-digit inflation, a wide current account deficit, a weak currency and high corporate debt.

&gt; &amp;quot;We think these steps will be insufficient to reduce by much the gap between inflation and the central bank&amp;#039;s five percent medium-term target, or to reduce the volatility of Turkey&amp;#039;s real effective exchange rate.""

"If you buy a 10m house with 20% down, your monthly mortgage is $40k ($39,899.41 3.49% 25yr). That is roughly $480k per year. 2% of your house cost for annual maintenance is $200k, making that a total of $680k. 


Using PFC recommendation of 30% to 40% of housing cost from your income, that would be $1.7m to $2.26m of your after tax income. I think you basically pay 50% tax rate at that level, so your income would be $3.4m to $4.6m to afford a $10m house.


Personally, I believe at that level of wealth, your housing cost would be alot lower as a percentage of your income. Mainly because you got other luxury expenditures such as exotic car, yatch, golden AK47s etc. I think this is referred to lifestyle inflation here. There is also alot of keeping up with the joneses at this point too. "

Participants were randomly recruited by telephone using live agents and administered a survey. The  results were statistically checked and weighted by age and gender using the latest Census information and the  sample is geographically stratified to be representative of Ontario. The margin of error for a random survey of 500 residents of Ontario is  ± 4.4 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.

It is noteworthy that the error is +/- 4.4 though. That is higher than I've seen for other polls."

China's market is not US driven, it doesn't buy US goods, and it can easily stop buying the ones it does. If the US can't outsource to China however, the consumer market collapses, and so does much of the world's, because no other country can manufacture at the scale of, and at the price of China. Not even India. There's a reason why literally everyone opposes a trade war, it'd destroy America's consumer supply lines, which are integral to it's GDP, and the rest of the world's consumption"

&gt;One of the main things that the economic commentators in the west don't understand is that the Chinese government build's these things not out of market pressures but by looking at the long term trend, millions of people in China will have to live in a city at some point for China to continue growing. These cities are being built beforehand so they don't have a housing shortage (ironically, although the CCP has tried to prevent this the sheer speed of urbanization is outpacing the construction boom).

"&gt;How has he violated the President's 4th amendment rights? With a warrant?

Well beyond the fact that he grabbed privileged communications between the president, his attorney and businesses (things Mueller has no constitutional right to see), a host of DOJ regulations were violated including DOJ regs expressly baring prosecutors from purposefully seeking out non-in office related ""crimes"" by the president. Furthermore they are explicitly told in the regs to not go to the judiciary to issue broad warrants against the President as this is considered politicizing the judiciary, and the dept (for good reason). Mueller did it anyway with the help of a hack Obama judge.

Now let's dive further, Article II gives the president sole authority to direct, stop, end, mandate, change, fire, anyone in the DOJ or what they're investigating, and that includes special counsels. They are part of the DOJ and subject to the President's whims and desires and demands.

Let's go further, Article II empowers the president to execute the laws of the country, in doing so Trump has what's called ""executive privilege"" where no man, woman or child in the US (outside of Congress) can question his thoughts motives or reasoning for a particular action, Furthermore as the DOJ, under Trump, by seeking out and getting privileged communications that contain his current and previous thoughts, motives, actions have violated Article II and the separation of powers.

You can read more about the fucking behemoth of bullshit Constitutional fuckery that Rosenstein and Mueller have just opened up:
http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1887&amp;context=fss_papers

Realize that this is so fucking complicated and so fucking illegal and unconstitutional by a strict interpretation that there's almost zero chance in hell Mueller can defend himself in public impeachment hearings over it. Furthermore, his choices on how to do this, through Democratic partisans at every stage, through democratic Obama appointed judges, through highly partisan leftists like Preet bahara leave him open not only to attack, but the entire DOJ and FBI.

Trump is, easily, and I mean easily, obligated at this stage to fire everyone. Not to protect himself, as Trump is not actually under any real danger, but the Constitution itself.

More trustworthy than the propaganda spewed by NAR are the reports by independent unbiased third parties such as the learned economists at Department of Economics - Center for the Study of Industrial Organization (CSIO), Northwestern University AND Stanford University and National Bureau of Economic Research. These guys have exactly zero dog in the fight and have both the resources and skills to actually analyze the data. Both studies conclude that in an apples to apples comparison there is essentially zero difference between the sale price of FSBO properties and those properties ""represented"" by agents skimming 6% off the top although FSBOs take a little longer.

"I've never bought dual agent but I'm gonna chime in on the closing cost question. When I purchased I went from city to rural and knew there would be a lot of extras needed( tractor., plowing, yard necessities that come with acreage) so I offered my estimated closing cost over asking and asked buyers to pay closing costs up to that amount. This allowed it to be rolled into the mortgage for me while buyers still received asking price."
"Some of those costs are fixed. Some of them are not. Your agent/attorney should be able to tell you which are fixed and which are not.  Here is a good summary of the fees and what they are for: http://granitelaw.com/tb_respa.html

Off the top of my head, your HOA fees and initiation fee are not negotiable, as those are set by the HOA.  Your taxes are not negotiable and are fixed, usually a set % of the purchase price.

Your interest rate on your loan might be negotiable, but that really just comes down to what the lender is wiling to give you.  You can shop the home insurance and appraiser but may not do much better.  You could get your own surveyor but again, price might not be much better. 

Why don't you go to your local credit union and see what their costs would be and do a comparison? That's going to be your best data point."

&gt;“In summary, the CDC funded a flawed study of crime-prone inner city residents who had been murdered in their homes. The authors then tried to equate this wildly unrepresentative group with typical American gun owners.”

I saw that, but it doesn't answer anything about case control and why it is wrong for this study. It also doesn't provide any proof about the line ""CDC funded a flawed study of crime-prone inner city residents who had been murdered in their homes""

"All the polygraph does is measure bodily functions like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure  sweat, etc. All it does is measure stress. The lie detector part comes on the assumption that if you are feeling stressed when asked questions, then you are obviously lying because only deceitful people will feel stress when being interrogated. And that is a major reason why polygraphs are compete bullshit. Once you know what they are looking for you can manipulate your breathing and heart rate so you can pass. And there are people who find being interrogated so inherently stressful that they will fail a polygraph even if they’re 100% truthful and even if they know how a polygraph really works. And really that’s the only value they have for the FBI and CIA interviews. If you can’t hold your shit together long enough to beat a simple polygraph, then you’re most likely not cut out to be in those agencies.

"Well, I’m no Cuomo fan, but Cuomo has also pledged to ‘fix the subways’ and allocated hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency funds to the MTA, who also hired a guy who turned Toronto’s subway system around and who people are fairly positive on.

Cuomo has also passed universal Pre-K, signed a bill to legalize gay marriage before the Supreme Court legalized it nationwide, is in the middle of a major infrastructure upgrade all over the city, including expanding Penn Station into a future Moynihan Station, rebuilding major bridges in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island, handled a major disaster in Hurricane Sandy and rebuilt and storm-proofed the tunnels around Manhattan, building the East Side Access Tunnel that will bring LIRR trains into Grand Central and ease up traffic into Penn Station, struck a deal to add another tunnel to Penn Station to NJ (until it was kiboshed by Christie), and rebuilding LaGuardia Airport. He’s enacted a $15/hr minimum wage in NYS, along with paid Family Leave, cut state taxes for middle class families, increased the budget for the Environmental Protection Fund, and made state colleges FREE for families that make under $125,000, and banned assault rifles in NYS after the Sandy Hook shooting.

It's quite something else to be in awe at a leader who used non\-violent means to turn an election and a leader who stooped to so low in morality to promote racism covertly which just smacks of desperation. That's not someone to be in awe at. That's someone who can't lead by logic or reason and who obviously has low opinions about humanity.

"I think the focus should be on getting  the states to start introducing it. Maine at the moment is flirting with RCV for June primaries, and has a ballot measure in allowing it to apply to federal elections. If this can be successful in Maine, then it could soon spread slowly.

I believe the GOP is the main opposition to RCV in the state, since the spoiler effect tends to help them, so governorship and control of Maine state legislature are also important to get. Anyone from Maine correct me if I am wrong."

"Bcash praises p2p and cheap transactions. If this really matters to you, try Nano. 1-5 second *confirmed* transactions, p2p, and *zero* fees forever.

BCH is just put a bandage on the scaling issue. Real life payments and transactions should not take time,  it needs to be more liquid than that. Instant and zero as possible fees. That money has to move quickly for some people and businesses. The transaction fees will add up even if they were set to 1/sat per byte. If BCH gets worldly adopted and goes up to let's say a conservative $1m per BCH, each satoshi is 1 CENT. That is around $6 per transaction. Oven if they managed to cut the transaction size times TEN, it would still be around $0.60 per transaction. It cannot scale on chain for so many reasons but people want on chain transactions so bad because of the security it brings and that's understandable but it just can't work to handle small and micro transactions. You're better off investing in Nano or any other neat crypto than BCH."

"I can sort of see how this might have happened. The city was probably thinking something like having community group volunteers pick up errant dog poop and otherwise keep the public park as clean as they might. Lots of public parks have volunteer groups that do things like that.

You could charitably call that a miscommunication between the parks department and the community group, or you could say the community group decided to see what they could get away with for as long as the parks department didn't notice.

"The thing is they don't know about your budget/goals/whatever. Using their metrics of 43%-50% of gross income going toward total debt, if you don't have other debt it can be a huge number that they say they can get for you. But they don't factor things in like being behind for retirement, or having huge tax bills, or expensive habits/hobbies, saving up for big ticket items instead of financing them, a chunk of your money going to care for others or what-have-you. 

Same as they don't give you key advice about retaining an emergency fund that is commiserate with your risks and obligations and not spending every cent on your house down payment and closing costs. 

Also, you're in a notably high cost of living area, where it's much more likely that you'll have to pay a larger share of your income to housing. That's how those areas work. I am not, and that leads to a big gap in reasonable to unreasonable since they'll seem to fund me as if I lived in San Diego too. "
"Finding a property manager is not the end of your involvement with this property, just the beginning as a landlord. Managing the manager will become most of your interaction. Finding tenants, budgeting repairs, estimating upgrade costs, handling eviction, and other routine management activities will likely take some attention, even if you have a manager. You will likely have to pay for legal representation during an eviction and may be liable for repair costs incurred as well.

The reason that I ask about where you'll live is that you'll need someone to check in on your property, and your landlord may or may not do it. I rented the same apartment for 3 years. My lease included annual inspections, but it never happened, not once. There could have been water damage, cigarette stains,  a dog, whatever, and the PMs would not have known. They probably got paid $12,000/year to manage the property for all the units and I never saw them.

"Does the listing price reflect the current condition of the house?  What did your real estate agent say about the price?

A 10 year old roof isn't that old.  A roofing company should be able to tell you how much life the roof has in it.  I just sold a house with a 10 year old roof and it was still like new - at least 20 years left on the life of the shingles.

"&gt; Simply that it held the United States to a very different standard than other countries (not just lesser developed countries).

How? It called for developed countries to contribute to the GCF in fairly vague terms. The amount that we pledged, $3 billion, was voluntarily any not determined by the terms of the agreement.

Trump could have changed the pledge to a lower value, or removed it entirely without exiting the agreement. He left not because of the GCF pledge but because of our NDCs which he was nullifying by tearing down the regulations that would have enabled them.

Don't take this personally but Trump and the Republican party in general has been spreading a ton of lies about this."

"1) Gathering, properly categorising and analyzing data regarding your business is very important. It will give you the knowledge about your customers choices, most successful trends in the market, seasonal influence, best pricing point etc. 

2) Study your established competitors and learn from them.

3) Separate business expenses from your personal expenses.

4) Debt is important for growing a business. More capital means more profit. However, you need to learn everything about it before taking loans.

5) Try to recruit trustworthy and efficient employees, believe me it is incredibly tough to get decent quality employees even in a country of more than 1 billion people.

6) You may suffer losses at the beginning. Consider it as your tuition fee for learning that business, and so don't get disheartened."

It seems to me that Trump is arguing that the attorney and client privilege is so sacrosanct that it even protects criminal conspiracy.
"&gt;I've characterized my experiences with Trump supporters that way because literally every experience I've had with a Trump supporter has gone the exact same way. In my case it's really not hyperbole. You are the first person who's been willing to talk in way that isn't directly antagonistic. 

Still not a fair way of doing things. You have to remember trump's approval is around 50% for a reason. There are plenty of people who support Trump and they are of all different types, you cannot judge all by a few.

&gt;I don't know the specifics of this situation beyond what I read in the article, but yeah, I think firing a gun into the air is dangerous, and I think most gun enthusiasts would agree.

I suppose that's because you live in a densely populated area. If you lived in a more rural area, the effective range of a pistol can be fired.

&gt;. As for why I'm not scandalized that he didn't tweet about it, it's simply because that story didn't make national news the way the waffle house guy's did. For whatever reason, it just wasn't as big a story. 

See, right there. Think about that. WHY is it not a big story, yet the waffle house was? WHY? Because if Trump doesn't tweet about it, it can be argued as racist. If Trump doesn't tweet about the white guy saving a life with ar-15 they can't do anything. The whole reason they're making a pointless stink about this situation is to preserve a narrative.

&gt;. Here's another take on black unemployment.. The graph about halfway down is particularly informative. Kurtzleben shows us here that [unemployment has fallen before]

OK, so there's that. Regardless they picked up to levels we had not seen since 1980 in Obama's time, does that mean Obama's same policies that are curing unemployment also caused them? Frankly I think the unemployment cause was the rise and decline of the economy, which is what Trump is strongly attempting to push for.


&gt;I do not think Donald Trump is racist for not tweeting about the waffle-house hero. I do think he is racist though. I think this because of a pattern of behavior that includes his failure to tweet about the waffle-house hero.

This is the narrative the media wants you to believe. That's **why** they're pointlessly blowing this up out of proportion.

&gt;while I think some of the items are bit of a stretch...

OK, so I could really get into this, but at the very least you're moderate enough to see that the new York times is unfair to him.

&gt;Trump hired Steve Bannon as his campaign head and later White House chief strategist. Under Bannon’s leadership, the website Breitbart made white nationalism a central theme. It featured a section, for example, on “black crime.”

I have gone to breitbart, I assure you it is not a white nationalist website. Tracking news articles about black crime data isn't racism.

&gt;Trump endorsed and campaigned for Roy Moore, the Alabama Senate candidate who spoke positively about slavery and who called for an African-American Muslim member of Congress not to be seated because of his religion.

Hillary Clinton campaigned for barry goldwater, who opposed civil rights, and furthermore was mentored by a major leader of the Klan.

I don't believe Trump endorsed him for the sake of oppressing minorities, but because he felt the guy would support him on major issues such as the wall.

&gt;In the 1990s, Trump took out advertisements alleging that the “Mohawk Indian record of criminal activity is well documented.” At the time, he was fighting competition for his casino business.

I'm pretty sure this one shoots its own foot, he was targeting a competing industry and likely was not interested in oppressing or claiming his race was superior with the advertisements intention.

&gt;In a November 2017 meeting with Navajo veterans of World War II, Trump mocked Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas.”

The veteran himself said he wasn't offended, even going so far as to say, ""back when they made me say 'Geronimo' I wasn't offended."" Furthermore, Trump was clearly intending to attack Warren's claim of native American heritage, and not the Indian race.

&gt;Trump once referred to a Hispanic Miss Universe as “Miss Housekeeping.”

Wouldn't surprise me, but it seems to be nothing more than a joke he made long ago as an entertainer. We can't become a country like Britain, that overreacts to these types of jokes.

&gt;Trump has trafficked in anti-Semitic caricatures, including the tweeting of a six-pointed star alongside a pile of cash. 

This is extremely wrongfully representative of him, he tweeted the star of David in a completely different meme he probably didn't even know the connotation.

http://i0.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/screen-shot-2016-07-02-at-12-29-09-pm.png?resize=1600%2C900&amp;quality=80&amp;strip=all

This is, by the way, the image he tweeted. Did you bother to look or did you just judge him?

&gt;He began his 2016 presidential campaign with a speech disparaging Mexican immigrants as criminals and “rapists.”

He also said they were also many good people. Furthermore, approximately 90% of the young women coming across the border illegally are raped. Though granted it's the coyotes doing it too, if you look at sanctuary cities, it's been found while crime as a whole is lower, violent crime and rape are actually higher. Make of that what you will.

&gt;Honestly, if any other president had done any ONE of these things, their career in politics would be over.

You really haven't been following much of the Clintons news, have you?

&gt;Now, if he'd tweeted about it when the story was first coming to light and it was blowing up in the news, that definitely would have been a step in the right direction.

But you are saying at this point, you've already found him guilty there's nothing he can do to satisfy you on this matter. You wouldn't give him a chance even if he tried. Furthermore his actual press secretary already made a statement here, which is far more than a tweet.

&gt;No, that article was definitely saying Trump is racist because he didn't tweet about Mr. Shaw, no question. To be clear, I don't love that article, and I'm definitely not going to Salon.com to be informed. This article is basically just pandering to anti-Trump zealots who want to jerk off to some ""Trump dun goofed"" porn. That being said, I don't think it's ""fake news."" It's just shitty, non-constructive, journalism. 

I can half agree with you.

&gt;Unfortunately, the list of things I do not agree with him on is very, very long. It's almost everything, I'm afraid. He is a climate change denier, he supports torture and the death penalty, he's spoken in favor of an assault rifle ban, which I like, but he's also spoken in support of assault rifles, ""military style weapons"" and high capacity magazines, which seems to be in conflict with himself. To name a few. 

He supports torture in the sense that terrorists are tortured, it was something all presidents did as an expected evil for common good. Climate change isn't necessarily proven, I'm not a denier myself, but regardless of Trump pulling out, we're still funnily enough meeting climate agreements under trump.

&gt;Are there any Trump policies that you disagree with? Where do you and he not see eye to eye?

Several of his woman agenda policies he discussed with Trudeau, including the council for women entrepreneurs.

https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-trudeau-launch-women-business-leaders-council/article/2614665

His backpedalling on serious issues such as ""DONT BOMB SYRIA"" which he later did.

His military spending binge. I want him to make the military more efficient, not more funded.

His pro-death penalty stance. I personally don't agree with it, not from the expected moral stance you might hope I would though.

&gt;How do feel about his tenuous relationship with the truth?

He certainly exaggerates and gets things wrong from time to time but he doesn't often lie about too much serious issues. Fact checking websites give him an almost notoriously aggressive liberal bias. As an example:

https://i.redd.it/x7oi5njhf7ry.png

Another:

https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/cover32.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all

&gt;Do you have any concerns about his aparent distaste for the freedom of the press? 

Until he impedes it no, I don't. Him being angry with them is completely normal, because they have been almost obsessively hateful and defaming. They don't just target him, they target his family. They clearly released those pissgate documents, knowing full well how false they were, as an attempt to manipulate voters on election day. Trump has probably had one of the most conflict with the media of any president.

His threat to sue NYT was over libel, not for accurate coverage. They strongly implied Trump sexually abused women, this was alleged and not proven, it is not an accurate portrayal of Trump or his actions. The NBC threat was to delicense them as a news source for openly lying about him. When they claimed Comey would testify against him, the dow dropped 250 points. They said nukes increased tenfold, which he outwardly decried as fake news. There has to be a limit to the attacks on reputation a news source can make.

"Of course you don't. It's emotional, reactionary, and self-serving (in the sense that it only serves to make you feel better). Let's just assume he's a ""nazi""--whatever you mean by that. Even still, the fact that he has offensive views means you can harass him? What else can it justify? If he's not entitled to be free from harassment, what else do his viewpoints allow you to do to him? 

It's a slippery slope. When you justify ill-treatment based on any subjective viewpoint you stifle civil dialogue and engender demagoguery. You, ironically, help justify his ideology and reinforce his thinking.  "

"It's not that USD isn't popular, it's that there is no easy way to use it on the web or internationally without going through a bunch of intermediaries.

Cryptos will eventually be integrated into the web so that you can pay to download a file, view a newspaper article, or get a camslut to take her clothes off for you, all without converting from USD to JPY/CNY/CND/THB/TWD/EUR/RUB/whatever.  Filipino maids in Hong Kong can send their pay to their families without paying Western Union 8%.  People in tightly controlled systems like Brazil and Venezuela can buy goods internationally without having to hire people to stand in lines to get government approvals first.  People in third-world shitholes can save their money in a form that their shitty governments can't devalue any time that some Prime Minister decides he needs a new fleet of Mercedes, and they'll be able to use that money to buy goods anywhere in the world.

You can use USD informally all over the world.  It's just not nearly as convenient as Bitcoin can become."

"&gt;Satoshi's plan for Bitcoin was for everyone to run a full node. This is exactly what he said on the Bitcoin forum.

This is absolutely and provably false. He actually said the exact opposite, on bitcointalk. Quote with source link below:

&gt;The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.

"I’ve had success using products available in Superdrug and on ASOS 😊.

**Salicylic acid products**: Nip and Fab Dragon’s Blood Fix Cleansing Pads, Nip and Fab Teen Skin Fix Cleansing Pads, Superdrug Deep Action Anti-Blemish Overnight Serum.

**Glycolic acid products**: Pixi Glow Tonic (from ASOS), Nip and Fab Glycolic Fix Liquid Glow 6% Cleansing Lotion, Nip and Fab Glycolic Fix Pads. Superdrug also do an own-brand range of glycolic products but the fragrance in them irritates my skin and broke me out in closed comedones. 

Hyaluronic acid also breaks me out for some reason, so I don’t use it. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel Moisturiser contains it though and lots of other people like it. 

The Ordinary has a range of products too. I haven’t tried anything from them, but they’re inexpensive and people seem to like them.

"Well, then how about you stop voting for the party that weaponized the law enforcement and intelligence wings of the executive branch?  Just a thought."
"I think conservative ideas align perfect for black families, but the problem is optics, in that conservatives believe in universal rules/treatment (mostly). And the Democrat preach the social justice mantra that states they a have special rules for the black community that is uniquely for them. The problem is there isn’t one. The best thing is to Improve opportunities and eliminate the negative incentives (like welfare punishing two parent households). 

Think about west and Owens as pulling a Trump; North Korea was afraid that trump would really do something to them — something they knew previous admins would not— West and Owens are saying to the DNC we will work to undermine that near 100% if things don’t improve, that the democrats have taken that vote as a given and even demean those who question. 

It is time that stopped, the community needs to let the current standard bearers know that their support is not permanent and let the other side know that they are willing to hear what they have to offer. As it is now the democrats know the community will vote for them no matter what (so why bother helping them over some other bloc) and the republicans know they will not get the vote of the community so why bother tailoring their message or platform to attract them. 

Simply put I think the near universal support of one party undermines the political power the black community really has.

Edit: I think west is a flake myself, but I am glad he has sparked this debate."

There was a video that Nutnfancy did on this subject a while ago where he talked about some guy who drew a gun in an instance of road rage. That might be a good resource for you instead of constantly asking me to explain to you the same misconception you have 50 times over or however long you're not going to grasp this.

Do you seriously need me to explain to you that a behavior pattern exists, and a very simple one at that, with examples?

"Trump's own lawyers have said Trump is a ""subject"" of the investigation. So yes, he is under investigation.

This is a pointless argument at the end of the day. Almost everything requires some amount of trust. Bitcoin decentralizes trust and that's the most important part of all this.

"&gt;Warehousing people who cannot function in society is a better outcome for them than the solutions sought in the past by other more severe governments.

Go spend some real time in one of the lower end ""warehouses"" for the elderly, and then come back with a report.

NYC has a fuckton of Muslims, probably more than any other major city in the US, and there's not an issue with ""no go zones"" or terrorism, or places removing pork from their menu etc. I think they just need to monitor certain circles and people more closely, Muslim or not. Sadly, I think heavily policing the internet would put a dent in attacks of all kinds.

"To quote a comment I made earlier,

&gt;Youre missing a lot, actually. NVCN was recently sued because one of their employees came from a similar company and used trade secrets to assist in the development of a similar Neovasc product. On top of this, over 70 million in damages were awarded to the company that they copied. Neovasc tried to request an appeal, which was granted, but ended up in neovasc losing, with an additional 50 million in damages being awarded. Neovasc, on the verge of being bankrupt due to this, was only able to pull together the original 70 million, currently being held in escrow for the sueing company. Neovasc is, again, trying to appeal to a higher court. Theyre attempting to do everything they can to get out of paying this, as this is literally their company's future being sued for. They have little to no funding, all their money is in escrow, and their primary product is currently in limbo. Add to this that they reported a large loss in profits (warranted, but reported all the same), and you have a huge recipe for disaster. The primary issue with them being bought is that whatever buying company would inherit their debt, which is a huge turn off to any buyout deals. Buy ratings are often very off, usually because they take the numbers into consideration and not why the numbers are what they are. There is a reason NVCN is a meme stock right now. The ONLY benefit to grabbing them, is that technically, if you have fistfuls of cash, you can own massive amounts of shares for very little money. On top of this, they were threatened to be delisted, and have until September to raise their profits, or more likely, R/S. Spoiler alert, R/S is never a good thing.

&gt;TL;DR - Neovasc is a cheap stock that only has 2 options. To the moon, if the lawsuit works out for them, or into the fucking dirt and delisted if it doesn't. Either way, neovasc is something you shouldn't invest in unless youre ready to ride the train to what will probably be a bitter end. If you MUST invest in NVCN, buy a few thousand shares, then forget about it. Drop it. Do nothing with those shares until you hear news of either the lawsuit, or a R/S. Then reevaluate. 

The end result is youd have to be a fool to hang on this long. Don't get stuck carrying the bags. That's exactly what youre doing.

"I'm of the opinion where I believe sewer inspections are more important than home inspections.  Anyone can walk a home and observe any significant structural damage.  Nobody can see what's going un underneath the surface.  On my inspections with clients I've never come across anything I'd consider major during a home inspection, but a number of times have discovered massive problems with the sewer line that would result in tens of thousands of dollars in repair.  

Just to be clear, I'm encouraging you to always do both.  If the home is newer the chances of the sewer line being anything but PVC/ABS plastic are slim and thus far less likely to present any issues.  Small price to pay for peace of mind."

1) Encourage the recipient even more to sell the SNAP card for cash on the black market. They already do this, but it would be more prevalent. 

2) Maybe, just maybe, the program restrictions would suck so bad, they’d opt out to get a job after eating Lima beans for a week straight. (Doubt it)

"Some of the comments here amount to little more than name calling. Kate Nicholson has written a powerful article founded on her own experience and study. There are many more like her.
America has a real public health crisis in addiction and street drug overdose deaths. But the primary role of over-prescriptions of druge in the 1990s was NOT to transform pain patients into addicts. Our drug ""epidemic"" grew partly from left-over prescription drugs stolen by kids from family medicine closets or given by relatives to under-insured people who never saw a doctor. Published data on hundreds of thousands of post-surgical patients prescribed opioids reveals that managed medical exposure to opioid pain relievers is associated with rates of opioid use disorder of less than 1%.
The typical addict is an adolescent or early 20s male with a history of family trauma from economic hardship and mental health problems. Few young males see a doctor for pain severe enough to justify long term use of opioid pain relievers.
The typical chronic pain patient is a woman in her 40s or older with multiple underlying medical problems. In women whose lives are stable enough to be able to see a doctor for pain, addiction is statistically rare. Thus the demographics of a supposed connection between prescriptions and addiction simply DO NOT WORK!

"Enrironmental Scientist, Geochemist, checking in. I am working on the Envirnmental Case for Bitcoin and POW. Some quick points: Energy use is not the problem it's how is the energy produced. Bitcoin/POW incentivizes the use of the cheapest energy, and fossil fuels can't compete with green tech (solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, geothermal, OTEC, wave, etc.) for much longer. Competition for mining power will lead to proliferation of green energy infrastructure across the globe as mining can be participated in from anywhere, think space race except for remaking the energy grid. Inflation requires continuous growth in consumption, resource use, and enviromental exploitation, deflation may alow growth without increased consumption. The US is dragging it's feet with climate action because of ties to Saudi Arabia and Oil pricing in dollars and because the Oil infrastructure was built with loans that need to be paid back (politicians on the take from banks and oil companies), weakening oil reliance = weakening the dollar and potential default on loans from outstanding debt, Bitcoin/POW can weaken oil and the banks expediating the transition. I'm not done with my idea yet, comments? "

"&gt;we retained Fusion GPS to provide research on multiple candidates in the Republican presidential primary ... The Free Beacon had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele

So what makes the Washington Free Beacon's self-serving statements implicitly believable but something like CBS ""heavily biased""?

&gt;No they didnt.

The Free Beacon hired Fusion GPS to do opposition research on Trump. Opposition that they stopped funding that Fusion GPS then shopped around to the DNC. Without the Free Beacon's funding there would be no Steele Dossier because Fusion GPS would not have had research on Trump's Russian connections to shop around. Arguing that the Free Beacon didn't ask for a dossier from Steele explicitly when they were getting research on Trump's shady Russian business dealings is a distinction without a difference. Particularly since the FBI had all this information already. So what's the purpose in perpetuating that narrative?"

"You do realize every single person in the simpsons is a massive stereotype right? 

Home is a fat dumb white dad that works at an evil company with an evil boss. Marge is a stay at home wife angry at the kids and smarter than her husband. Lisa is a pie in the sky liberal daughter and Bart is a bratty punk skater kid always getting into trouble. You could not come up with a more stereotypical tv trope white family that mocks each stereotype.

On top of that. Chief Wiggim? He's literaly a large obese cop that is obsessed with donuts and as dumb as a board. His son is so dumb he seems handicapped. Smithers is a well\-dressed well groomed closeted gay guy that's secretly in love with his boss. Flanders, the Christian, is as mockingly stereotypical against christians as you can be, he's super nice on the surface, constantly has pent up rage, he's so over bearing to his kids that it borders child abuse, and he has outbursts of rage. Every freaking character in the show is a complete stereotype. Get over yourself man. 

Do you see christians protesting over Flanders?

Do you see white working class protesting over Homer?

Do you see police protesting over all the Chief Wiggim? 

Do you see gay people protesting over Smithers?

Nope, you just see one kid, pretending to be offended, protesting over one character in the show. 

On a side note, simpsons isn't the only show that even does this. Look at family guy. Do you know the jewish character that's obsessed with money on that show? He's a 10x worse more forceful stereotype than apu is. Again, no jews protesting about him. If you can't take a joke then you shouldn't be watching a comedy show. The whole point of them is to make fun of eachother. And simpsons does it pretty tactfully and evenly. "

"Exactly. The US has been so terrified of waking the beast for 50 years and Trump simply doesn’t give a shit. My guess? North Korea would disarm and move towards peace if there was a reasonable guarantee that Kim Jong Un and his family will be given protection and be able to remain in power.  I’m skeptical too, but Kim Jong Un isn’t dumb, and he realizes that he has finally come face to face with a president who has such little diplomatic skills that he can no longer effectively do his nuclear pump fake in exchange for foreign aid and loosened sanctions.

My biggest concern is that Trump will get ahead of himself if this goes as planned, and will think Iran will bend to him as well.  That’s a lot more dangerous of a situation, and Iran has plenty of official allies, whereas North Korea has about 30% of one."

"I am currently a Boy Scout and finished my Eagle badge last year.  My problem with letting girls in is not because of some irrational fear of the unorthodox, but rather it damages the purpose of the organization.  Boy Scouts ranges from fifth grade to high school.  So in every troop you have kids wining, crying, and struggling.  In Boy Scouts, boys learn how to help and lead each other.  If girls are let in, then they will naturally address be the ones taking care of all of the little kids crying.  But sometimes these boys need leader and not just mothers.  I am not saying a girl cannot fulfill the former, but the latter is much more naturally prevalent.  In education girls are striving much more as modern education has been built more to cater to them.  In today’s schools, boys just can’t be boys.  They can’t have any light rough housing, adventure, or any other natural characteristic of boys, and it is hurting their development.  In Boy Scouts younger boys can pursue these repressed urges unlike in school.  Now they will have the judgement of more mothers and no longer can just be boys. 

And also the more commonly addressed point:  
We had a girl visit our troop a few weeks ago.  About ten Scouts started hitting on her within the first five minutes of the meeting.  We were supposed to be cleaning our patrol boxes out which got delayed to next meeting because our Scouts were unusually extra distracted. "
